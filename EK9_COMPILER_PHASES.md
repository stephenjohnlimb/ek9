# EK9 Compiler Phases Implementation Guide

This document provides detailed guidance for implementing and understanding the EK9 compiler's 22-phase compilation pipeline. This is the specialized reference for compiler phase development, symbol table management, and phase interdependencies.

## Compilation Pipeline Overview

The EK9 compiler follows a **22-phase compilation pipeline** organized into three main stages:

### Frontend Phases (0-3)
- **Phase 0: PARSING** - ANTLR4-based parsing
- **Phase 1: SYMBOL_DEFINITION** - Symbol table creation  
- **Phase 2: DUPLICATION_CHECK** - Duplicate detection
- **Phase 3: REFERENCE_CHECKS** - Reference validation

### Middle-end Phases (4-18)
*Detailed phase implementations will be documented here*

### Backend Phases (19-21)
- **Phase 19: IR_GENERATION** - Intermediate representation generation
- **Phase 20: CODE_GENERATION** - Target code generation  
- **Phase 21: PACKAGING** - Application packaging
