# EK9 IR and Code Generation Guide

This document provides comprehensive guidance for working with EK9's Intermediate Representation (IR) and code generation to various targets. This is the specialized reference for compiler backend development, optimization passes, and target-specific code generation.

Content will be added as Steve and I work on compiler backend development, moving away from Java implementation details to focus on EK9's intermediate representation and multi-target code generation capabilities.
