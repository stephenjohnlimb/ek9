      <h1>Traits in EK9</h1>
    </header>
    <p>
      The <b>trait</b> has been touched on in the <a href="structure.html#trait">structure</a> section. This shows how
      a <i>trait</i> can be used to control/limit <i>class</i> <u>extension</u>.
    </p>
    <h3>Main uses for <i>traits</i></h3>
    <p>
      If you are familiar with Java you may consider that <i>traits</i> are just like a <u>Java Interface</u>;
      there are some similarities but also several features in EK9 where <i>traits</i> play a significantly
      different role. In fact the <i>trait</i> unlike the <u>Java Interface</u> provides real structural
      enabling/constraining power.
      In many ways it provides much more control than a <i>class</i>, but less implementation functionality;
      and <b>no</b> retained state.
    </p>
    <p>
      Take your time when reading this section and reviewing the example. If you've used other programming
      languages <b>don't</b> assume that the <i>trait</i> in EK9 is just some minimal cut down
      <i>abstract class</i> that can be skimmed over.
    </p>
    <h4>The main features/characteristics</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Constraining Class Extension</li>
      <li>Providing a signature interface</li>
      <li>Trait inheritance</li>
      <li>Facilitates Composition</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="traits_example">Traits Example</h3>
    <p>
      There are quite a few ideas covered in the following example; these are discussed following the example.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <i>program</i> 'ProcessorTest' below creates a number of 'Processors' and then iterates over those
      'Processors' and calls <b>process</b> to get a 'ProcessingResponse'. That response is then passed to
      'ResultBuilder' via the <b>build</b> method to create an output String.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are different 'Processor' <i>classes</i> that exhibit the <i>trait</i> of 'Processor'. This
      is to demonstrate how different implementations can exhibit the same <i>trait</i> (they all meet the same signature).
      The 'Processor' <i>trait</i> also inherits from <i>traits</i> 'CostAssessment' and 'Moniterable'. The
      <i>Method</i> <u>lowCost</u> is declared in both of those <i>traits</i> (to demonstrate a name clash).
    </p>
    <p>
      The 'DelegatingProcessor' shows how <u>composition</u> works. There are also two <i>classes</i> of
      'StringResponse' and 'StructuredResponse' that both exhibit the <i>trait</i> of 'ProcessingResponse'.
      This provides a <i>method</i> called 'result()'.
    </p>
    <h4>The Example</h4>
    <pre>#!ek9
defines module introduction

  defines trait

    CostAssessment
      lowCost() as pure
        <- rtn <- true

    Moniterable
      available() as pure
        <- rtn <- true
      lowCost() as pure
        <- rtn <- false

    Processor with trait of Moniterable, CostAssessment
      process()
        <- response as ProcessingResponse?

      override lowCost() as pure
        <- rtn as Boolean: CostAssessment.lowCost()

    ProcessingResponse allow only StringResponse, StructuredResponse
      result()
        <- rtn as String?

  defines class

    StringResponse with trait of ProcessingResponse as open
      theResponse as String: String()

      StringResponse() as pure
        -> response as String
        theResponse :=: response

      StringResponse() as pure
        this(String())

      override result()
        <- rtn as String: theResponse

    StructuredResponse is StringResponse
      contentType as String: String()

      StructuredResponse() as pure
        ->
          response as String
          contentType as String
        super(response)
        this.contentType :=: contentType

      StructuredResponse() as pure
        ->
          response as String
        this(response, "text/plain")

      contentType() as pure
        <- rtn as String: contentType

    SimpleProcessor with trait of Processor

      override process()
        <- response as ProcessingResponse: StringResponse("Simple Message")

    DelegatingProcessor with trait of Processor by proc
      proc as Processor?

      DelegatingProcessor() as pure
        -> processorToUse as Processor
        proc: processorToUse

      DelegatingProcessor() as pure
        this(SimpleProcessor())

      override lowCost() as pure
        <- rtn as Boolean: false

     XMLProcessor with trait of Processor
      override process()
        <- response as ProcessingResponse: StructuredResponse("&lt;tag&gt;Simple Message&lt;/tag&gt;", "text/xml")
      override lowCost() as pure
        <- rtn as Boolean: false

    //I've used a slightly different layout here and also used named parameters as an example.
    JSONProcessor with trait of Processor
      override process()
        <- response as ProcessingResponse: StructuredResponse(
          response: `{"name": "John", "age": 31, "city": "New York"}`,
          contentType: "application/json"
        )

    ResultBuilder

      build() as dispatcher
        -> response as ProcessingResponse
        <- rtn as String: response.result()

      build()
        -> response as StringResponse
        <- rtn as String: `"${response.result()}"`

      build()
        -> response as StructuredResponse
        <- rtn as String: `${response.contentType()} (( ${response.result()} ))`

  defines program

    ProcessorTest
      stdout <- Stdout()

      processors <- [ SimpleProcessor(), XMLProcessor(), DelegatingProcessor(JSONProcessor()), JSONProcessor()]

      for processor in processors
        response <- processor.process()
        stdout.println(ResultBuilder().build(response))

//EOF</pre>
    <p>
      The output of the <i>program</i> above would be:
    </p>
    <pre>
"Simple Message"
text/xml (( &lt;tag&gt;Simple Message&lt;/tag&gt; ))
application/json (( {"name": "John", "age": 31, "city": "New York"} ))
application/json (( {"name": "John", "age": 31, "city": "New York"} ))
        </pre>
    <p>
      The <i>class</i> 'ResultBuilder' is acting as a <u>decorator</u> (design pattern), it has the
      ability to access the additional method <u>contentType()</u> because the <b>dispatcher</b>
      has ensured the right <i>method</i> is called with the right <b>type</b> of parameter.
    </p>
    <h4>What has been shown in the Example</h4>
    <p>
      The example above is quite sophisticated in terms of structure control. Each aspect of <i>traits</i>
      is discussed below.
    </p>
    <h4 id="allow_only">Constraining Extension</h4>
    <p>
      As outlined above; a <i>trait</i> can be used to control the degree to which <i>classes</i> may extend the
      <i>trait</i>. This can be very useful in the development of API's, library classes and sub systems. If the
      developer needs to ensure that the traits/classes they have developed can be used (but not extended)
      by users of their API; then applying constraints on a <i>trait</i> provides a flexible way of accomplishing
      this. EK9 also has the limitation of extending classes by default if they are not <b>open</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
      In some other languages the use of <b>final</b> is the only mechanism to limit extension. Some
      languages have <b>sealed types</b> similar to this concept.
    </p>
    <p>
      See:
    </p>
    <pre>ProcessingResponse allow only StringResponse, StructuredResponse</pre>
    <h4>Providing a signature interface</h4>
    <p>
      This is the traditional use for <u>interfaces/traits</u> it really just consists of a set of <i>method</i>
      signatures. The <i>trait</i> can then be used in abstract way.
      Both 'Processor' and 'ProcessingResponse' are really just signatures, although 'ProcessingResponse' also
      constrains the <i>classes</i> that may use it as a <i>trait</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      With <i>traits</i>; concrete (non <i>abstract</i>) <i>methods</i> can be implemented (a little like default methods
      on interfaces in Java). The <i>trait</i> 'Processor' has such a method; <u>lowCost</u> demonstrates this.
      The <i>class</i> 'XMLProcessor' overrides this method to demonstrate that it is possible alter the
      implementation if needs be.
    </p>
    <h4>Trait inheritance</h4>
    <p>
      Inheritance/multiple inheritance of <i>traits</i> is also supported
      as shown with 'CostAssessment', 'Moniterable' and its use in 'Processor'. However, there is a significant point to
      note here, where two <i>methods</i> like <u>lowCost</u> conflict - the <i>trait</i> or <i>class</i> where they are
      used together has to override that method.
    </p>
    <p>
      The resolution of this conflict is shown in the 'Processor' <i>trait</i>. It overrides the <u>lowCost</u> <i>method</i>
      and then delegates the call to <u>CostAssessment.lowCost()</u> it could have used <u>Moniterable.lowCost()</u> or
      indeed just used <u>true/false</u>.
    </p>
    <h4>Composition</h4>
    <p>
      One of the biggest benefits of defining <i>traits</i> in EK9 is the ability to use automatic <u>composition</u>.
      In the example there are a number of 'Processors' these are aimed to processing data to produce a
      'ProcessingResponse'. The
      <b>DelegatingProcessor with trait of Processor by proc</b> demonstrates the use of <u>composition</u>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <b>by proc</b> syntax is the key part here; this syntax triggers the delegation of the trait methods to the 'proc'
      private field object. This simple directive means that the class can now direct all calls to that delegate, but can
      optionally elect to override and provide the method implementations itself.
      <b>Just take a moment and think about what that means</b>; delegation is now as easy as inheritance!
      It might not always be appropriate, but now you have a simple syntax option to adopt delegation.
    </p>
    <p>
      As you can see it is not necessary to implement all the <i>methods</i> that 'Processor' defines when
      using <u>composition</u>.
      All the other 'Processors' have to implement the <i>abstract methods</i> defined in 'Processor':
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>SimpleProcessor with trait of Processor</b></li>
      <li><b>XMLProcessor with trait of Processor</b></li>
      <li><b>JSONProcessor with trait of Processor</b></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The additional use of <b>by proc</b> is the mechanism for <u>composition</u>; this expects a
      Property/Field in the 'DelegatingProcessor' called 'proc' which <b>is of type</b> 'Processor'.
      Just by using this statement (and creating 'proc' and setting it) all the method calls to
      the 'DelegatingProcessor' will be automatically routed to that delegate.
    </p>
    <p>
      The construction of the 'DelegateProcessor' with
      <b>DelegatingProcessor(JSONProcessor())</b>
      could have been done with an 'XMLProcessor' parameter and the behaviour would have been altered.
      This is <u>composition</u>; it is way more flexible in many ways than inheritance. It also enforces/
      reinforces encapsulation and direct re-use.
    </p>
    <p>
      Importantly it is possible to use this with any number of <i>traits</i>;
      and so compose <i>classes</i> out of a range of other <i>classes</i> with compatible <i>traits</i>;
      through the use of <u>composition</u>. As <i>classes</i> can exhibit multiple <i>traits</i>;
      class behaviour can be <u>composed</u> from multiple <i>classes</i>, in a way similar to
      multiple class inheritance (but much simpler and more maintainable).
    </p>
    <p>
      It is still possible to override the <i>methods</i> for some parts of the 'Processor' signature
      in the <i>class</i> should you wish to. So in the example above, the <i>method</i> <u>lowCost</u>
      is not delegated but is re-implemented. But <i>method</i> <u>available</u> has been delegated.
    </p>
    <h5>Thoughts</h5>
    <p>
      The use of <i>traits</i> provides way more than just a 'set of method signatures'. Yes is can and
      should be used for that. It has way more power; by facilitating easy delegation and constraining
      the <i>classes</i> that can use it. It is not just an <b>abstract class</b>!
    </p>
    <p>
      Please take some time to understand the <i>trait</i> because it is quite different to what most other
      programming languages offer.
    </p>
    <h4 id="dispatcher">Dispatcher</h4>
    <p>
      While not really related directly to <i>traits</i> the <i>class</i> 'ResultBuilder' has a <i>method</i>
      called <u>build</u>. That <i>method</i> is marked up as a <b>dispatcher</b>.
      Interestingly that class has two other <i>methods</i> also called <u>build</u>, but with different
      parameter types.
    </p>
    <p>
      The important point of the <b>dispatcher</b> syntax is that it removes the need for detecting the
      types of <i>classes/traits</i>. This is done with the <u>build</u> <i>method</i> and parameter of
      'ProcessingResponse'. This is just the base <i>trait</i>, but by marking the <u>build</u> <i>method</i>
      as a <b>dispatcher</b>; EK9 will look at the actual type of Object passed in and then automatically
      call the appropriate <u>build</u> method. This is covered in more detail in section <a href="advancedClassMethods.html">
      advanced class methods</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      This feature removes the need to <u>cast</u> Objects or use any syntax like <u>instanceof</u>, EK9
      does not support casting or the detection of <b>types</b>. You could view the <i>class</i> 'ResultBuilder'
      as a sort of 'switch statement for types'. It has a default behaviour, but will attempt to find a <i>method</i>
      that accepts the type the parameter actually is - rather than just the type that was passed in.
    </p>
    <p>
      The biggest advantage of this approach is the retention of Object-Oriented approach and the avoidance
      of 'class cast exceptions'. Using 'casting' and 'instanceof' techniques creates <u>brittle</u> code
      that does not <u>refactor</u> easily.
    </p>
    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <p>
      <i>Traits</i> can be used in a very sophisticated and flexible manner to provide control and abstraction.
      They allow Objects to be viewed in different but complementary ways and facilitate design through <u>composition</u>
      rather than just <u>inheritance</u>.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you ever find you need functionality from one <i>class</i> in another <i>class</i>, don't just think
      of an inheritance structure as this can be very limiting. Consider <i>traits</i> and <u>composition</u>
      by refactoring <i>classes</i> into smaller units and extracting method signatures out to <i>traits</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      You may find that holding what would have been 'class properties' in a <i>record</i>, then using <i>traits</i>
      to define <b>control</b> and 'signatures' with a range of <i>classes</i> and <i>dynamic classes</i> an alternative
      approach to just using <u>inheritance</u>. If you also combine this approach with 'function delegates', you have
      quite a different way to implement functionality.
    </p>
    <p>
      It may take some time for patterns to emerge that make the most of the delegation facilities in EK9.
    </p>
