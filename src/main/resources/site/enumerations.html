      <h1>Enumerations in EK9</h1>
    </header>
    <p>
      The <b>Enumeration</b> was briefly outlined in the <a href="structure.html#type">structure</a> section.
      It is shown in more detail here in the form of an example. This shows the <i>operators</i> that
      are built in to every <i>enumeration</i> as standard.
    </p>
    <p>
      The idea of an <i>enumeration</i> in general is very simple, it is a predefined list of values.
      EK9 considers the list to be an <i>ordered</i> list, with the value being the order they are defined.
      Note EK9 does not use the keyword word <i>enumeration</i> or <i>enum</i>; but just considers
      them to be a simple <b>type</b>.
    </p>
    <h3 id="example">Enumeration Example</h3>
    <p>
      The example below shows how <i>enumerations</i> can be used and combined with <i>records</i>
      and <i>functions</i>. It shows all the operators available and how each of the values of and
      <i>enumeration</i> can be 'streamed'. Importantly it shows how you can obtain an enumerated value
      from a <i>String</i> (but note if the <i>String</i> does not represent any value the result is
      <b>unset</b>).
    </p>
    <p>
      The EK9 <b>is Set</b> nature also applies to <i>enumerations</i>, this is quite dissimilar to other
      programing languages. So in EK9 it is possible to have an enumerated value this is actually <b>none</b>
      of the valid <i>enumerated</i> values, i.e. it is <b>unset</b>.

    <h4>The Enumerations</h4>
    <p>
      There are two <i>enumerations</i> defined. This example is based around playing cards.
      So there is the <u>CardSuit</u> and the <u>CardRank</u>. The values of which are obvious (Aces high).
      As you can see, they are just a list of values! But in a list under the name of the <i>enumeration</i>.
    </p>
    <h4>Using the Enumerations</h4>
    <p>
      To represent a playing card, both of the <i>enumerations</i> have been used as fields/properties on a
      <i>record</i>. To make the <i>record</i> a little more useful; the operators <u>is set</u>,
      <u>to string</u> and <u>promote</u> have been implemented. A <i>class</i> could have been used for this,
      but in this example a <i>record</i> will do.
    </p>

    <h4>Functions</h4>
    <p>
      The <i>abstract</i> <i>function</i> <u>cardCreator</u> is used in <u>fullRankCreator</u> as part of
      the <i>dynamic function</i> <u>deckPopulator</u>. If the use of
      <a href="functions.html">functions</a> and <a href="dynamicFunctions.html">dynamic functions</a>
      is not something you've read about yet then jump over to those sections and read up on them.
      An explanation on how these are used is given in the following paragraphs relating to the
      <i>program</i> <u>DeckOfPlayingCards</u>.
    </p>
    <h4>Operators</h4>
    <p>
      All the supported <a href="operators.html">operators</a> on <i>enumerations</i> are shown in
      <i>program</i> <u>ShowOperators</u>. These are all the sort of operators you would probably
      expect:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Comparison</li>
      <li>To string</li>
      <li>To hash code</li>
      <li>Is set</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      But also note the mechanism to obtain an <i>enumerated</i> value from a <i>String</i>.
    </p>
    <h4>Enumerated values in a Switch</h4>
    <p>
      Many programming languages, just as Java and C# tend to promote the use of methods on <i>enumerations</i>.
      This is not possible (nor desirable - opinion) in EK9. As previously stated EK9 does not permit
      <i>methods</i> on <i>enumerations</i>. Instead, it promotes the use of <a href="composition.html">composition</a>,
      so in the example above you can see the use of a <a href="flowControl.html#switch">switch</a>
      statement that writes out some appraisal of the card drawn.
    </p>
    <p>
      The EK9 approach is to separate the enumerated value and some sort of business logic (in this case the
      appraisal of the card drawn). If there needs to be some close binding, then use a <a href="classes.html">class</a>
      with a property of the <i>enumeration</i> and a <a href="methods.html">method</a> that has the appraisal logic.
      Alternative maybe one or more <a href="functions.html">functions</a> could be used to make the appraisal.
      It is also possible to use a combination of a <a href="classes.html">class</a> and a
      <a href="functions.html">function</a> delegate in combination.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you wished to augment the <i>enumeration</i> with other supporting information (maybe an image in the
      case of playing cards), then use a <a href="collectionTypes.html#dict">Dictionary</a> with the key being the
      enumerated value and the value being the image. Again, this approach uses <a href="composition.html">composition</a>,
      which in general is more flexible in the longer term. You might argue this approach is less Object-Oriented (which it is),
      but in EK9 you have the choice to use <a href="classes.html">classes</a> or just <u>data structures</u> and
      <a href="functions.html">functions</a> to operate on them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Have a read of some quotes by <a href="https://www.cs.yale.edu/homes/perlis-alan/quotes.html">Alan Perlis</a>.
      Specifically "It is better to have 100 functions operate on one data structure than 10 functions on 10 data structures".
      The point here is that there alternative mechanisms than just Object-Orientation to structure solutions when designing
      software.
    </p>
    <h4>Program DeckOfPlayingCards</h4>
    <p>
      This <i>program</i> is designed to highlight how it is possible access all the enumerated values.
      The first two examples just show how each of the enumerated values of the <u>CardSuit</u>
      and <u>CardRank</u> can be streamed through a pipeline process, converted to a String and
      printed to 'stdout'. The third demonstrates how an <i>enumeration</i> can be converted
      to a 'List of ...', should it be necessary.
    </p>
    <p>
      The final part of the program is a little more involved and interesting. It starts off
      by showing a double nested loop that creates a <u>Card</u> and prints the details of that
      <u>Card</u> to stdout. As you can see this is fairly straight forward, using the
      <i>enumeration</i> <b>type</b> as if it were a collection of values (which in a way it is).
    </p>
    <p>
      The last line of the example shows the same functionality as the previous double nested
      loop but in a functional manner. The <u>CardSuit</u> being streamed into a <b>map</b> <i>function</i>
      called <u>fullRankCreator</u>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <u>fullRankCreator</u> is designed to accept each CardSuit as it is sent into the pipeline.
      It then creates a <i>dynamic function</i> (a bit like a lambda in some ways). Importantly this
      <i>dynamic function</i> <u>captures</u> the suit. The other key point here is that the
      <i>dynamic function</i> actually <b>extends</b> the <i>abstract function</i> <u>cardCreator</u>.
      Now the <u>fullRankCreator</u> uses the newly created <i>dynamic function</i>
      by streaming each of the <u>CardRanks</u> into it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <i>dynamic function</i> uses the captured <u>CardSuit</u> and the streamed <u>CardRank</u> to create
      a <u>Card</u> <i>record</i>. As the newly created <u>Cards</u> come out of the pipeline they are
      piped into <b>rtn</b> with is a <i>List of Card</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally in the program, a <i>List of Card</i> comes out of the pipeline for each <u>CardSuit</u>,
      but as we really just want all the Cards to be printed to 'stdout', we use <b>flatten</b> to take
      each card out of the <i>List of Card</i> so they can be sent to 'stdout'.
      Now as we wrote a <u>promote</u> operator on the <u>Card</u> <i>record</i> that promotes the <u>Card</u>
      object to a <i>String</i> so it can be just printed.
    </p>
    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <p>
      Whilst this section is really about <i>enumerations</i> (which are very simple) it seemed more useful
      to show how <i>enumerations</i> could/should actually be used. Here the contrast between a more functional
      approach has been taken with streaming pipeline processing, <i>functions</i> and <i>dynamic functions</i>
      with closure/capture of variables. This can be seen in comparison to the double nested loop of
      <u>CardSuit</u> and <u>CardRank</u>.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the processing like the above example is simple; then a more procedural approach is probably a better
      option. With EK9 you have the choice of either styles. But if you find yourself will lots of complex
      logic deep in nested loops or need to <b>break</b> out of them, then consider a more functional approach.
      But with EK9 you have a choice of functional and Object-Oriented or a blend of the two.
