      <h1>EK9 Network Types</h1>
    </header>
    <p>
      These EK9 Network Types are all related to network communications or protocols.
    </p>
    <h3>The Types</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="#udp">UDP (Datagrams)</a>,
        <a href="#udp_server_example1">Server(1)</a>,
        <a href="#udp_server_example2">Server(2)</a>,
        <a href="#udp_client_example1">Client(1)</a> and
        <a href="#udp_client_example2">Client(2)</a>
      </li>
      <li><a href="#tcp">TCP (Sockets)</a>,
        <a href="#tcp_server_example1">Server(1)</a>,
        <a href="#tcp_server_example2">Server(2)</a>,
        <a href="#tcp_client_example1">Client(1)</a> and
        <a href="#tcp_client_example2">Client(2)</a>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h4 id="worked_example">Worked Example</h4>
    <p>
      For each of the network <i>types</i> above there are examples.
      There are some explanations of the examples; but assuming you've read many of the
      other sections on EK9; the syntax and rationale/approach should start to be familiar.
      If you've not read the other sections on <a href="builtInTypes.html">Built in Types</a>,
      <a href="collectionTypes.html">Collection Types</a> and
      <a href="standardTypes.html">Standard Types</a>, you should read those first.
    </p>

    <h4 id="udp">UDP Examples</h4>
    <p>
      There are two server examples and two client examples for
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_Datagram_Protocol">UDP</a>;
      each of which shows different ways that UDP could be used. These range from
      imperative type examples to more functional examples utilising Stream pipelines. The initial
      packet size of a UDPPacket is 512 bytes, you can alter the size of the packet but this may make it more
      likely that packets will be dropped by the network. You must remember that UDP packets are not guaranteed to
      be delivered (this is not an EK9 thing, it is the very nature of UDP).
      Whilst this may seem strange; it does work well for some types of application that can accept
      some data loss.
    </p>
    <h5 id="udp_server_example1">UDP Server (1)</h5>
    <p>
      Below is a simple imperative code style of processing (echoing) UDP messages
      (until the message 'end' is received). It listens on port 4445 and blocks to
      <b>receive()</b> packets, it echos the packet back.
    </p>
    <pre>#!ek9
defines module introduction
  defines program
    UDPServer1()
      stdout <- Stdout()
      udpConnection <- UDP(NetworkProperties(port: 4445))

      while udpConnection?
        packet <- udpConnection.receive()
        if packet?
          if packet.content == "end"
            endPacket <- UDPPacket(packet.properties, "OK will stop Server")
            udpConnection.send(endPacket)
            udpConnection.close()
          else
            udpConnection.send(packet)

      stdout.println("UDP Server Complete")

//EOF</pre>
    <br/>
    <p>
      If you wanted to use the <b>iterator</b> syntax, the code above could have been written as follows:
    </p>
    <div class="highlight ek9-code">
      <ul class="code-lines">
        <li>
          <span class="k">while</span>
          <span class="m">udpConnection</span><span class="k">?</span>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="m">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
          <span class="m">packet</span>
          <span class="k">&larr;</span>
          <span class="m">udpConnection</span><span class="k">.</span><span class="m">receive</span><span class="k">()</span>
        </li>
        <li>...</li>
        <li>
          <span class="k">while</span>
          <span class="m">udpConnection</span><span class="k">.</span><span class="m">hasNext</span><span class="k">()</span>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="m">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
          <span class="m">packet</span>
          <span class="k">&larr;</span>
          <span class="m">udpConnection</span><span class="k">.</span><span class="m">next</span><span class="k">()</span>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <p>
      If you are from a Java/C/C++/C# or Python background this will probably be the way you would have thought
      of coding up a simple UDP server. However, there is an alternative approach that those with a more
      functional background may prefer - take a look you may also find this approach appealing.
    </p>
    <h5 id="udp_server_example2">UDP Server (2)</h5>
    <p>
      This example has broadly the same functionality as Server (1) above, except that it:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>It uses more of a functional code style to service requests.</li>
      <li>Uses a signal to stop servicing requests rather than some value in the content itself.</li>
      <li>Accepts command line parameters for: port, packet size and signal to trigger end servicing requests.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      As you can see with this example, the EK9 Stream pipeline used to continuously accept incoming UDP packets
      then pass them through a function (just echos content back) and then send what it echoed back to
      'Standard Out'.
    </p>
    <pre>#!ek9
defines module introduction
  defines function
    UDPPacketHandler() as abstract
      -> incoming as UDPPacket
      <- outgoing as UDPPacket?

  defines program
    UDPServer2()
      ->
        port as Integer
        packetSize as Integer
        signal as String

      stdout <- Stdout()
      udpConnection <- UDP(NetworkProperties(port, packetSize))

      //This time stop server with abort signal not content 'end'.
      abortHandler <- (udpConnection) is SignalHandler as function
        result: 0
        stderr <- Stderr()
        stderr.println("Received abort Signal closing connection")
        udpConnection.close()

      Signals().register(signal, abortHandler)

      echoFunction <- (udpConnection) is UDPPacketHandler
        outgoing = incoming
        udpConnection.send(outgoing)

      cat udpConnection | map by echoFunction > stdout
      stdout.println("UDP Server Complete")

//EOF</pre>
    <br/>
    <p>
      Clearly there is a bit more code to this example, but then it is doing more.
      Handling command line parameters (though these could have come from
      <a href="standardTypes.html#envVars">Environment Variables</a> if you prefer).
      It also terminates via signal handling rather than message content.
    </p>
    <p>
      Importantly it uses a <i>dynamic function</i> that extends an <i>abstract function</i> to process the
      incoming packet. With this approach it is quite possible to be able to create any amount of processing
      both before the packet content is echoed back and after echoing.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example; incoming packets could be filtered before echoing to check for 'band words' and those could
      be recorded together with the originating hostname/ip. The number of times specific words were sent in
      could be accumulated and statistics gathered. Content length above a certain size could be ignored and not
      responded to.
    </p>
    <p>
      In short the functional approach enables more flexibility and future extension, rather than mixing all that
      varied logic inside the imperative processing loop. But this is an <u>aside</u> to the functionality
      in the <b>UDP</b> class.
    </p>
    <h5 id="udp_client_example1">UDP Client (1)</h5>
    <p>
      This example shows how a client using UDP could connect to one of the servers defined above.
    </p>
    <pre>#!ek9
defines module introduction
  defines program
    UDPClient1()
      stdout <- Stdout()
      stderr <- Stderr()

      try //use a try block with a closable resource, auto close
        -> client <- UDP(NetworkProperties(timeout: 250ms))

        packet1 <- UDPPacket(NetworkProperties("localhost", 4445), "A Test")
        stdout.println(`Sending [${packet1}]`)
        client.send(packet1)
        stdout.println("Waiting for response")
        response1 <- client.receive()
        if response1?
          stdout.println(`Received [${response1}]`)
        else
          stderr.println(`There was no response [${client.lastErrorMessage()}]`)

        packet2 <- UDPPacket(NetworkProperties(host: "localhost", port: 4445), "end")
        stdout.println(`Sending [${packet2}]`)
        client.send(packet2)
        stdout.println("Waiting for response")
        response2 <- client.receive()
        if response2?
          stdout.println(`Received [${response2}]`)
        else
          stderr.println(`There was no response [${client.lastErrorMessage()}]`)

      stdout.println("UDP Client Complete")
//EOF</pre>
    <br/>
    <p>
      As you can see this example also uses the <b>UDP</b> network class, but this time no port parameter is
      given. Also note that the <b>UDP</b> instance is both created and a timeout is set to receive packets.
      This is done within the incoming <b>try</b> parameter, this means that the resource will be automatically
      <u>closed</u>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The detail of where to send the content for the UDP message is all bound in the creation of the
      <b>UDPPacket</b>, this is then sent out via the <b>UDP</b> class.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note that the example above shows that the client is expecting a response, depending on the server logic,
      this may not always be the case. But this client is expecting some unreliability in message transmission
      as so has set a timeout of <u>250 milliseconds</u> and does check if the response packet is valid. In the
      case of not receiving a packet withing the timeout the <b>UDP</b> class will return and empty packet.
    </p>
    <p>
      As you can see the client code above is again quite imperative/procedural in nature.
    </p>
    <h5 id="udp_client_example2">UDP Client (2)</h5>
    <p>
      This example shows how a client using UDP could connect to one of the servers defined above. But this
      example is more functional and also processes a number of command line parameters.
    </p>
    <pre>#!ek9
defines module introduction
  defines type
    List of String

  defines function
    packetConverter() as abstract
      -&gt; content as String
      &lt;- outgoing as UDPPacket?

  defines program
    UDPClient2()
      ->
        hostname as String
        port as Integer
        timeout as Millisecond
      try
        -> udpConnection <- UDP(NetworkProperties(timeout))

        //This is the nearest we get to a lambda, inline dynamic function
        //You must use () for the single line you are allowed.
        cat ["A Test", "Middle Item", "end" ]
          | map (hostname, port) extends packetConverter (outgoing: UDPPacket(NetworkProperties(hostname, port), content))
          > udpConnection

      Stdout().println("UDP Client Complete")
//EOF</pre>
    <br/>
    <p>
      Just like the second server example this client expects a number of command line parameters, the
      initial setup of the <b>UDP</b> connection is the same as in the first client example. But this time the
      messages to be sent are just held in a <b>List of String</b>. These messages are then <b>pipelined</b> via
      a <i>dynamic function</i> that just wraps them in a <b>UDPPacket</b> with the correct hostname address and port.
      They are then pushed out via the <b>UDP</b> connection using the <b>&gt;</b> operator.
    </p>
    <p>
      Interestingly the <i>dynamic function</i> is simple and has been inlined. It could have been held as a
      <i>function delegate</i> or created using a higher level function. Here it has just been inlined.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note in this case, the client is not bothered whether the server responded or not. Because the
      <b>UDP</b> connection was opened in the <b>try</b> incoming parameter block it will be automatically
      closed.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is something about the functional approach that is more <i>elegant</i> in my opinion. Though I'm less
      keen on the inline dynamic function.
    </p>
    <h5 id="udp_summary">UDP Summary</h5>
    <p>
      As you can see from the above examples you can use a procedural or functional approach to working with <b>UDP</b>.
      The <b>UDP</b> protocol is quite useful for a range of application as long as you accept its limitations.
    </p>
    <h4 id="tcp">TCP Examples</h4>
    <p>
      There are a number of examples for
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol">TCP</a>
      (both client and server); each of which shows different ways that TCP could be used.
      The mechanism for TCP is different from UDP - TCP is connection oriented and more reliable than UDP.
    </p>
    <h5 id="tcp_server_example1">TCP Server (1)</h5>
    <p>
      The TCP server example below is again written in a procedural manner. The key conceptual difference between
      UDP and TCP is the connection oriented nature and the need to be able to service multiple client
      connections at the concurrently.
    </p>
    <p>
      TCP server connections can be fully available on a <u>port</u> via the network or just <u>local</u>
      (useful for just controlling local applications).
      The <b>TCP</b> constructor takes a <b>NetworkProperties</b> record which has a range of properties to control the <u>back log</u>
      (the number of connections that are waiting to connect).
      It also can limit the number of concurrent connections to service at the same time. This is the first time
      <u>multi-threading</u> has been mentioned.
    </p>
    <p>
      As an aside it is also possible to configure a read timeout on the connection so that if clients are slow in sending data, the connection
      can be dropped so another client can be serviced.
    </p>
    <pre>#!ek9
defines module introduction
  defines program  
    TCPServer1()
      stdout <- Stdout()
      stderr <- Stderr()

      stdout.println(`Version of program package is ${Package().version}`)

      tcpServer <- TCP(NetworkProperties(4446, 5, 4, true))

      if tcpServer?
        handler <- (tcpServer, stderr) extends TCPHandler as function
          stderr.println("Connection made")
          while input?
            line <- input.next()
            stderr.println(`Received [${line}]`)
            output.println(line.trim().upperCase())
            if line == "end"
              input.close()
            if line == "shutdown"
              tcpServer.close()
          stderr.println("No more input on connection")

        stdout.println("Awaiting connections")
        if tcpServer.accept(handler)
          stdout.println("TCP Server completed and shutdown")
        else
          stderr.println(`Was not able to service requests gracefully [${tcpServer}]`)
      else
        stderr.println(`Failed to get TCP server running [${tcpServer}]`)
//EOF</pre>
    <br/>
    <p>
      Note the the TCPHandler is a built-in abstract function with the following signature:
    </p>
    <pre>...
    defines function
      TCPHandler as abstract
        ->
          input as StringInput
          output as StringOutput
...
    </pre>
    <br/>
    <p>
      So when you define your handler, you get the <b>input</b> and <b>output</b> arguments inferred within your function implementation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <b>TCPHandler</b> plays a really important role in processing the actual requests made by
      TCP clients. The code in this handler will be called by multiple clients at the same time and therefore should not hold <b>state</b> unless
      it is protected and design to allow multiple (possibly) simultaneous accesses (more on this later).
    </p>
    <p>
      The line <b>tcpServer.accept(handler)</b> puts the software into a mode where it now <b>blocks</b> and waits for clients to initiate
      a connection (on port 4446 in this example).
    </p>
    <p>
      Once a client does connect; the <b>handler(input, output)</b> is called and the client
      requests can be serviced by using the <u>input</u> and <u>output</u> as these provide the connection from and to the client.
      This servicing will continue until the client disconnects (or in the case of this example sends "end").
    </p>
    <p>
      The important point to note here; is that the <b>tcpServer</b> goes back to listening for more connections while the <b>handler</b>
      is still running. This is where the multi-threaded nature comes in.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note that if the client sends "shutdown" in this example that actual server will close is listening port and hence will complete and exit
      (this would not normally be coded like this - see the next example for an alternative).

    <p>
      This server example is much longer, but does a few things that are more realistic for a real application.
      If you review the <i>program</i> <b>TCPServer2</b>, you can see that again command line parameters are processed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next thing the <i>program</i> does is create <u>two</u> <b>TCP</b> server connections.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first (<b>processingServer</b>)
      is a TCP server that processes connections from the network with a read timeout of 250 milliseconds with a backlog of
      2 connections and concurrent processing for up to 4 clients simultaneously. Note the use of a different layout and
      named parameters. This makes the configuration a little easier to see with so many parameters.
    </p>
    <p>
      The second (<b>controlServer</b>) is also a TCP
      server that only processes local connections to shut the whole application down
      (much like <a href="http://tomcat.apache.org/">Tomcat</a> works).
    </p>
    <p>
      Following this; two <i>dynamic functions</i> (<b>serverFunction</b>) are created that returns <b>serviceConnections</b>.
      Importantly that function accepts a <b>TCPHandler</b> that can deal with connected clients.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally the two <b>serverFunction</b>s are added to a <b>List</b>, this list is then used in a Streams <b>pipeline</b>.
      The important part here is that the <b>pipeline</b> uses the <b>async</b> command to <u>run</u> both of the
      <b>serverFunction</b>s concurrently. Clearly for this example that is <b><u>critical</u></b>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The program then effectively blocks in the <b>tcpServer.accept(handler)</b> for both TCP servers, as client connections
      are made the appropriate <b>handler</b> deals with this client communications.
    </p>
    <p>
      The main processing function is implemented in the <b>createHandler</b> <i>function</i>. It simply processes the
      <b>input</b> content from the client, converts it to upper case and sends that data to the <b>output</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <b>createShutdownHandler</b> <i>function</i> deals with accepting input and checking it is the same as the
      <u>shutdown</u> command. If the command matches then both of the <b>TCP</b> server sockets are closed.
      This then causes all processing to be shutdown.
      It is only at this point the main <b>program</b> line <b>'cat servers | async > stdout'</b> finally completes
      as those functions return.
    </p>
    <p>
      The important take away from the example above is that network communications (and signal handling) is inherently
      multi-process/threaded/concurrent in its very essence. EK9 provides a way to set the <u>stage</u> with the provision of
      handlers and functions and then enables concurrent processing to take place via the <b><u>async</u></b> part of the
      stream pipeline and deals with all the joining of calls.
      There is no <u>call back hell</u>, 'multi-tasking' is implied but its implementation is not explicit.
      So the implementation detail of how the two TCP services are actually managed by EK9 is an implementation detail and not
      one for the developer.

    <h5 id="tcp_client_example1">TCP Client (1)</h5>
    <p>
      The example below shows a procedural style TCP client application. The connection to the server is just closed at the end of the
      <b>try</b> block. The server will deal with this by detecting there is no more input and there it will close all its connections
      to this client.

      The above example is quite short and to the point, the next client example has a little more functionality.
    </p>
    <h5 id="tcp_client_example2">TCP Client (2)</h5>
    <p>
      More of a functional approach and is designed to connect to the TCP Server (2) example above, ie connect to both the
      processing port and the control port to shut the server application down.

      cat Optional(TCP(NetworkProperties("localhost", controlPort))) | map with shutdownFunction > stdout

//EOF</pre>
    <br/>
    <p>
      There are a couple of interesting ideas in this example, the first is using a <b>sender</b> <i>function</i> to
      accept incoming <b>String</b> values send them to the processing server and get the server response and send it along a
      <b>pipeline</b> and in this case to <b>stdout</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The second interesting point is to actually send a TCP object through a processing <b>pipeline</b> into a shutdown
      <i>function</i>; that sends "SHUTDOWN" to that TCP server by connecting, it then sends the result of what happened down the
      <b>pipeline</b>. This might seem like a strange approach, but it is just another different way of treating Objects and functions
      in a more functional manner.
    </p>
    <h5 id="tcp_summary">TCP Summary</h5>
    <p>
      Both client and server <b>TCP</b> connections can be constructed and utility in both a procedural and functional manner.
      There is a reasonable level of control of the TCP connectivity and the possibility to handle multiple concurrent connections.
    </p>
    <h4 id="http">HTTP</h4>
    <p>
      EK9 does have <a href="webServices.html">Web Services</a>; these are built on top
      of the <b>HTTP</b> server.
      The built-in <b>HTTP</b> server is not designed to be as massively configurable as implementations like
      <a href="http://tomcat.apache.org/">Tomcat</a>, <a href="https://www.eclipse.org/jetty/">Jetty</a>,
      <a href="https://www.nginx.com/">NGINX</a> or <a href="https://www.iis.net/">IIS</a>.
      It is expected that you would front any EK9 web implementation
      with a caching proxy server and would deploy instances of your application via a range of scalable containers.
    </p>
    <p>
      EK9 <a href="webServices.html">Web Services</a> can serve simple html content; but are really designed
      to serve dynamic content. It does however have built in logic and types to be able to support full REST
      services.
    </p>
    <p>
      The built-in types <i>HTTPRequest</i> and <i>HTTPResponse</i> have all the necessary structures to support
      the REST maturity model up to level 2. To move to level 3 (<b>HATEOAS</b>) the developer must define and provide
      the content (HAL/ATOM or bespoke). This means that <b>etag</b> and <b>last modified</b> headers are 'baked in'.
      So verbs like <b>PUT, PATCH</b> and <b>DELETE</b> can be used to EK9 mandates the use of headers to ensure
      up-to-date versions are being referenced. <a href="https://restfulapi.net/">RESTFULAPI</a> has more details on this
      if you are new to REST.
    </p>
    <h4>Conclusion</h4>
    <p>
      EK9 has included networking types in as part of the standard/network API right from the start because they
      are a key component in any modern programming language. It must be remembered that when developing
      any sort of networking type application UDP/TCP/HTTP there will be multiple concurrent threads of execution
      and that networks can and do fail.
    </p>
    <p>
      Designing your applications to be as stateless and pure as possible is recommended. However, there are times
      when concurrent access to shared data is necessary and EK9 provides a
      <a href="standardTypes.html#mutex">MutexLock</a> for this situation.
    </p>
