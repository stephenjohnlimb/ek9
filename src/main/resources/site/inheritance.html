      <h1>Inheritance in EK9</h1>
    </header>
    <p>
      There have been several examples of <i>inheritance</i> of various <b>constructs</b> in several of the
      other sections. See the <a href="index.html#examples">list of examples</a> for details.
    </p>
    <p>
      This section explains the use inheritance and also why other mechanisms are sometimes recommended.
      The concept of inheritance is an Object-Oriented one; EK9 uses this same concept but with
      <b>constructs</b> other than just <i>classes</i>. It is the valuable concept of <b>polymorphism</b>
      that is the vital aspect we are looking to employ; irrespective of the <b>construct</b>.
    </p>
    <h3>Constructs that support inheritance</h3>
    <p>
      EK9 has a number of <b>constructs</b> that are suitable for particular tasks, many of these support
      inheritance.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><i>records</i> - including <a href="records.html#example">abstract records</a> with single inheritance</li>
      <li><i>functions</i> - specifically <a href="functions.html#abstract_functions">abstract functions</a> with single inheritance.</li>
      <li><i>classes</i> - traditionally focused on <a href="classes.html#shape_example">base/abstract classes</a> with single inheritance</li>
      <li><i>traits</i> - single inheritance and <a href="traits.html#traits_example">multiple inheritance</a></li>
      <li><i>components</i> - supporting abstract bases and <i>injection</i> with single inheritance</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Rationale</h4>
    <p>
      EK9 does have a wide range of <b>constructs</b>; whereas many languages focus on <i>classes</i> or maybe
      just <i>functions</i> as the primary structural construct. Each of the <b>constructs</b> in EK9 is designed
      to provide functionality in a specific role. This means that capabilities such as inheritance/composition
      are used in a very specific manner and for some <b>constructs</b> must be limited (or enhanced).
    </p>
    <p>
      While it is true to say the mechanisms of <b>abstraction</b>, <b>encapsulation</b> and <b>inheritance</b>
      are important; <u>polymorphism</u> is really is the main power behind Object-Oriented Programming.
      EK9 applies polymorphism to several <b>constructs</b> in addition to <i>classes</i>; this widens its use.
    </p>
    <p>
      EK9 supports multiple inheritance of <i>traits</i>. This is to facilitate the development of Façades and enable
      a single class to support both inheritance and automatic delegation to other classes.
      <br/>
      <i>Traits</i> are all implicitly <i>abstract</i> and can therefore be extended. Take care here not to
      use multiple inheritance of <i>traits</i> to build a Façade with too many methods (and coupling).
      You may find that using <i>components</i> provides a suitable alternative and enables you to <u>compose</u>
      various implementations and hide the implementation details but expose just enough via the <u>component</u>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Functions</i> can also treated as <u>Objects</u> and can be <i>abstract</i>; this enables them to be used
      as <i>function delegates</i>; hence they may be used in an interchangeable manner in stream pipelines.
      They can actually be piped through pipelines and called (asynchronously if required).
      But importantly they are <u>type safe</u> and can be type checked. Only by having the concept of an
      <i>abstract function</i> could the actual types of functions being used, altered and varied in a
      type safe manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a href="functions.html">Functions</a> and <a href="dynamicFunctions.html">dynamic functions</a> are
      <b>not</b> <u>lambdas</u> - they are similar - but they are not (and are not designed to be) true
      <u>lambdas</u>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Classes</i>, <i>records</i> and <i>components</i> only support single inheritance, but <i>classes</i>
      can also <u>exhibit</u> multiple <i>traits</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Denoting <i>components</i> as a specific <b>construct</b> that support an <i>abstract</i> base, enables
      <i>components</i> can be injected (see <a href="dependencyInjection.html">dependency injection</a>).
      This is not the case with <i>classes</i> or <i>records</i> they cannot be 'injected'.
    </p>
    <p>
      Different constraints and capabilities on the <b>constructs</b> with respect to inheritance <u>enable</u>
      each <b>construct</b> to fulfil the role it is designed for, rather than attempting to force the
      <i>class</i> to fit every role.
    </p>
    <p>
      Those with and Object-Oriented background will probably feel at home with
      <i>traits</i> and <i>classes</i>. Those that have used <u>Spring</u> will probably see where
      <i>components</i> can fit in. Developers with a more <u>functional</u> background will look to
      <i>functions/records</i> (and <i>abstract functions</i>) with stream pipelines as their main focus.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is not necessary to use every type of <b>construct</b> in a solution; only use the features and
      capabilities you need or feel most at home with. For example C programmers may find just using
      <i>program</i>, <i>function</i> and <i>record</i> feels most natural to start with.
    </p>
    <p>
      With EK9, there are a number of tools (<b>constructs</b>) that are available; adopting a pure Functional,
      total Object-Oriented or a hybrid approach to development is your choice. For different projects you will
      probably alter the balance of the range of <b>constructs</b> used.
    </p>
    <h4>Extending Functionality</h4>
    <p>
      Only if a <b>construct</b> is <i>open</i> or <i>abstract</i> can it be extended but see
      <a href="traits.html#allow_only">traits</a> as these can provide more fine-grained control.
    </p>
    <h4>Overriding Methods</h4>
    <p>
      When looking to alter a <i>methods</i> functionality in <i>classes</i>, <i>traits</i> or <i>components</i>;
      the keyword <b>override</b> must be used. This is covered in more detail in
      the <a href="methods.html">methods</a> section. Actually the same applies to <i>operators</i> on
      <i>records</i>, <i>classes</i> and <i>traits</i>. If you are familiar with Kotlin/Java and have used the
      'Annotations' such as <b>@Override</b> then this concept will be familiar to you.
    </p>
    <h3>Additional Examples</h3>
    <h4>Records</h4>
    <p>
      The record <a href="records.html#example">example</a> shows additional
      properties being added to <i>records</i>, but also uses a wide range of <i>operators</i> including
      <b>overriding</b> <i>operators</i>.
    </p>
    <h4 id="function_example">Functions</h4>
    <p>
      Below is an additional example of <i>abstract functions</i>; this highlights how <i>functions</i> can be
      treated in an Object like manner. Also note this approach is
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID">SOLID</a> even though we are dealing with <i>functions</i>
      and not <i>classes</i>.
    </p>
    <pre>#!ek9
defines module introduction
  defines function

    mathOperation() as pure abstract
      ->
        x as Float
        y as Float
      <-
        result as Float?

    add() is mathOperation as pure
      ->
        x as Float
        y as Float
      <-
        result as Float: x + y

    subtract() is mathOperation as pure
      ->
        x as Float
        y as Float
      <-
        result as Float: x - y

    divide() is mathOperation as pure
      ->
        x as Float
        y as Float
      <-
        result as Float: x / y

    multiply() is mathOperation as pure
      ->
        x as Float
        y as Float
      <-
        result as Float: x * y

  defines program

    MathExample()
      stdout <- Stdout()
      stdout.println("Math Operation Example")

      for op in [add, subtract, divide, multiply]
        stdout.println(`Result: ${op(21, 7)}`)

//EOF</pre>
    <br/>
    <p>
      The above example demonstrates how the arithmetic functions can be defined to meet the same
      <u>signature</u> (mathOperation); and can be treated in a polymorphic manner. The loop in the 'MathExample'
      <i>program</i> can call each of the functions without having to be specific as to which <i>function</i>
      they are. But critically this is type safe and exhibits polymorphism.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are a couple of interesting points to note in this example above:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>EK9 detects the super-type of the functions when the list is defined as <b>mathOperation</b></li>
      <li>The <i>functions</i> are referenced when being added to the list, they are not called</li>
      <li>The type for the loop variable <b>op</b> is inferred as <b>mathOperation</b></li>
      <li>The loop variable <b>op</b> is actually immutable - it cannot be altered by the developer manually</li>
      <li>Within the loop the <b>op</b> is called with the parameters to produce a result</li>
      <li>String interpolation <b>``</b> has been used and <b>${ }</b> converts the returning Float to a String</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      One could imagine this type of dynamic capability being used in a wide range of applications that
      triggers varying functionality in specific circumstances (UI button clicks, for example).
    </p>
    <h4>Classes</h4>
    <p>
      This <a href="classes.html#shape_example">class example</a> shows
      several <i>classes</i> being <b>extended</b>, some are <b>open</b> for further extension.
      This second <a href="traits.html#traits_example">class example</a> shows <i>classes</i> with
      specific <a href="traits.html">traits</a>. This final <a href="composition.html#composition_example">example</a> shows
      how class inheritance can actually be avoided through the use of <u>composition</u>.
    </p>
    <h4>Traits</h4>
    <p>
      This <a href="traits.html#traits_example">example</a> shows <i>traits</i> being used for multiple
      inheritance and also controlling/limiting how <i>classes</i> can inherit from bases.
    </p>
    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <p>
      Inheritance is useful in many contexts; EK9 has attempted to limit inheritance in some scenarios and
      enhance it in others. It has also provided an alternative approach to extending and reusing functionality
      through <u>composition</u>.
    </p>
    <h3>Next Steps</h3>
    <p>
      Back to <i>functions</i>, specifically <a href="dynamicFunctions.html">Dynamic Functions</a>; these follow
      the same thread of inheritance (but inheritance from <i>abstract functions</i> delivering polymorphism).
