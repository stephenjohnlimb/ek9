      <h1>Generics/Templates in EK9</h1>
    </header>
    <p>
      Many of the examples have used the built-in <a href="collectionTypes.html">collections</a>;
      like <b>List</b> or <b>Dict</b>; these are <u>Generic/Template</u> classes that can be parameterised
      with another type.
      <br/>
      This is parametric polymorphism.
    </p>
    <p>
      There have also been examples of the definition of new <a href="structure.html#generics">generic</a> types.
      These show how both generic <i>classes</i> and generic <i>functions</i> can be developed and used.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is inline example at the end of this section, it shows how generics can be used in different
      ways and how the <b>types</b> used to parameterize a generic <b>type</b> can be controlled.
      The benefits of this control (<b>constraint</b>) are then discussed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before that however; it is necessary to discuss the way EK9 deals with generics/templated <b>types</b>.
    </p>
    <h2>Type Creation</h2>
    <p>
      When instantiating a new Object of a generic <i>class</i> and parameterizing it with one or more
      <b>types</b>; a new <b>type</b> is created (in effect).
      There are some implications around this, that might not be obvious.
    </p>
    <p>
      i.e. Just declaring: <b>List of Person</b> (where Person is an <b>existing type</b>), has actually created
      a new <b>type</b>; the 'List of Person' <b>type</b>!
    </p>
    <p>
      As an example consider an <i>abstract</i> base <i>class</i> of <b>Shape</b> and two <i>classes</i> that
      extend it, <b>Circle</b> and <b>Square</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now declare to use of <b>'List of Shape'</b>, a <b>'List of Circle'</b> and a <b>'List of Square'</b>.
      Three new <b>types</b> have been created, because you have declared their use somewhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      It should come as no surprise that you can:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Add a <b>Circle</b> to a <b>'List of Circle'</b> but not a <b>'List of Square'</b>,</li>
      <li>Also, you can add a <b>Square</b> to a <b>'List of Square'</b> but not a <b>'List of Circle'</b>,</li>
      <li>
        Adding both <b>Circles</b> and <b>Squares</b> to an instance that is a
        <b>'List of Shape'</b> will also be clearly acceptable; they both extend <b>Shape</b>.
      </li>

    </ul>
    <p>
      OK, all obvious and understandable. But what about passing the <b>'List of Shape'</b> as a
      parameter?<br/>
      More interestingly: "can a <b>'List of Circle'</b> be considered to be <b>'List of Shape'</b>"?
    </p>
    <p>
      Well an Object that has the type <b>'List of Shape'</b> can be passed about as a parameter.
      So that answers the first question, but the second question has an answer you may not be expecting!
    </p>
    <h2>A 'List of Circle' is <b>not</b> a 'List of Shape'!</h2>
    <p>
      But wait a 'Circle' extends 'Shape' so a 'Circle' is a 'Shape'. So surely this can't be right!
    </p>
    <p>
      If EK9 did allow this, then a <b>'List of Circle'</b> could be passed as a parameter where a
      <b>'List of Shape'</b> was needed. Then it would be possible to add 'Squares' to it!
    </p>
    <p>
      This is not what we want! So just because the generic type is parameterised with <b>types</b> that
      are compatible (in a polymorphic manner) it does not follow that the newly created <b>types</b> from
      parameterizing a generic <b>type</b> are compatible (polymorphic).
    </p>
    <h3>Separate Types</h3>
    <p>
      When generic types are parameterised with <b>types</b>; they define a new <b>type</b> and that new
      <b>type</b> does not have any sort of type hierarchy; i.e. it does not extend any other <b>type</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
      This point is important as it means that a <i>class</i> with two methods with the same name but different
      generic parameters is possible (this is unlike Java! There is <b>no</b> type erasure in EK9). i.e.
    </p>
    <pre>...
  defines class
    SimpleExample as abstract
      assimilate() as pure abstract
        -> items as List of Shape
        <- rtn as Shape

      assimilate() as pure abstract
        -> items as List of Circle
        <- rtn as Shape

      assimilate() as pure abstract
        -> items as List of Square
        <- rtn as Shape
...</pre>
    <br/>
    <p>
      In the short snip above, the <i>method</i> <b>assimilate</b> is 'overloaded' and this is possible
      because each of the parameters is truly a different <b>type</b>. While this might not be that surprising
      it is one of the limitations of Java with 'type erasure'. This is one of the reasons EK9 creates new types
      when generic types are parameterized.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is polymorphic compatibility between the <b>type</b> 'Shape', 'Circle' and 'Square'; but this
      should not lead you to believe that when an 'Optional', 'List', 'Dict' or any other generic type is parameterised with any of
      the above <b>types</b>, the resulting <b>types</b> will be compatible! <b>They won't</b>.
    </p>
    <h2>Constraining/Widening</h2>
    <p>
      The example below aims to show the benefits of <u>constraining</u> the parameterizing <b>type</b> that can be
      used with a generic <b>type</b>. While the word 'constrain' appears to be a limiting feature; which it is some ways.
      It actually enables more functionality in other ways.
      <br/>
      A reasonable analogy would be to consider an 'area'
      made from a 'width' and a 'height'. To keep the same 'area' but increase the 'width' you must reduce the
      'height'. By constraining the parameterizing <b>type</b> the 'width' is reduced, but to keep the same 'area',
      the 'length' is increased (this means that now it is possible to use <i>methods</i> on the <b>type</b>).
    </p>
    <p>
      Without constraining the parameterizing <b>type</b> 'T'; the generic <i>function</i> or <i>class</i> can
      only make a certain number of assumptions about <b>type</b> 'T'. In EK9 those assumptions are the
      provision of all the standard <a href="operators.html">operators</a>. This is another one of the reasons
      EK9 defines so many specific operators.
    </p>
    <h4>Operators</h4>
    <p>
      The developer creating a generic <i>function</i> or <i>class</i> can assume that when their generic
      code is used and parameterised with a specific <b>type</b>; that the <b>type</b> will provide all the
      operators they have used in their generic code. <b>If this is not the case</b>; then the compiler will
      fail to compile the code where the parameterization took place. The developer must now augment the
      <b>type</b> they intend to parameterize the generic code with, to include those <i>operators</i>.
      This was <u>one</u> of the reasons <i>operators</i> were included in EK9.
    </p>
    <pre>...
  defines function
    eventHandler of type T
      -> shape as T
      assert shape?
      //any other 'operator' on T can be used
...</pre>
    <br/>
    <p>
      So any generic code is limited to <u>only</u> use the standard set of <i>operators</i>! That might
      be a little too limiting; if you want to do anything beyond just 'collections' you need to call
      <i>methods</i>. This is the main reason EK9 allows the <b>constraining</b> of parameterized <b>types</b>.
    </p>
    <h4>Methods</h4>
    <p>
      It may be that the generic code needs to call some <i>methods</i> on the conceptual <b>type</b> 'T'!
      This can be done, but at a price! The price is that the generic code has to be constrained in some way
      to only work with <b>types</b> that have those methods! So in some ways the code in now <u>less generic</u>
      (i.e. it cannot be parameterised by 'any' <b>type</b>).
      But the upside is that additional <i>methods</i> can be called and functionality can be delivered.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this is effort/compromise is to retain compile time 'type safety'.
    </p>
    <pre>...
  defines function
    eventHandler of type T constrain by Shape
      -> shape as T
      assert shape?
      assert shape.description() != ""
      //any other 'method' on Shape can be used
... </pre>
    <p>
      The second snip above limits the eventHandler; so that it can only be used with
      'Shape' and its subclasses. So it is slightly less generic, but now specific <i>methods</i>
      on 'Shape' can be called!
    </p>
    <h2>The Example</h2>
    <p>
      This same setup EK9 source code will be used for all the examples, it is shown here once for brevity.
    </p>
    <pre>#!ek9
defines module introduction

  defines function

    //Generic function - now open so can be extended once parameterized.
    eventHandler of type T constrain by Shape as open
      -> shape as T
      assert shape?
      //Now it is possible access the 'description' method if needs be.
      assert shape.description()?

  defines class

    Text
      value as String?

      default private Text()

      Text() as pure
        -> content as String
        value: String(content)

      value() as pure
        <- rtn as String: String(value)

    Shape as abstract
      shapeInfo as String?

      private Shape()
        assert false

      Shape() as pure
        -> info as String
        shapeInfo: String(info)

      description() as pure
        <- rtn as String: String(shapeInfo)

      operator ? as pure
        <- rtn as Boolean: shapeInfo?

    Circle is Shape
      Circle() as pure
        super("Circle")

      roundness() as pure
        <- rtn as Float: 0.0

    Square is Shape
      Square() as pure
        super("Square")
... </pre>
    <br/>
    <p>
      The code above defines a number of simple <i>classes</i> around 'Shape' and also
      one called 'Text'; it is not part of that <i>class</i> hierarchy. The 'Text' <i>class</i>
      is only used in the following part of the example to highlight the <u>constraint</u>
      applied to <b>eventHandler</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <b>eventHandler</b> is a generic <i>function</i>; but in this case it has been <u>constrained</u>
      to work with 'Shape'. Through the use of <i>traits</i> it is possible to constrain generic
      <i>functions</i> and <i>classes</i> to work with a wide range of <b>types</b> as long as they conform to
      a specific <i>trait</i>.
    </p>
    <h3>Example 1</h3>
    <p>
      The example code below uses the <i>functions</i> and <i>classes</i> defined above to show how a
      <i>dynamic function</i> can be refined from generic <i>functions</i>. In this case the
      generic <i>function</i> <b>eventHandler</b> is extended.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <b>textHandler</b> below is commented out as an example of how the 'constrain' mechanism is
      enforced by the compiler. The other 'handlers' <b>shapeHandler</b>, <b>circleHandler</b> and
      <b>squareHandler</b> can all be defined without error (unlike the <b>textHandler</b>).
    </p>
    <p>
      A <b>ShapeEventProcessor</b> <i>class</i> (which is defined a little later) is 'captured' as
      a variable in the <i>dynamic functions</i>. This is to highlight the type safety and strong
      typing with generics. It also highlights how it is possible to move from a generic type 'T' to
      the actual <b>type</b> that has been used in parameterization.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <b>shapeHandler</b> <i>dynamic function</i> is a function delegate; it results from the
      parameterization of the generic <i>function</i> <b>eventHandler</b> and the <b>type</b> 'Shape'.
      It is possible to redefine the function body as shown below; where the shape is passed through
      to the eventProcessor (the captured variable), by using <i>method</i> 'processShapeEvent'.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the functionality in the generic <i>function</i> is all that is needed; then it is not necessary to
      provide a new function body. i.e. <b>shapeHandler &lt;- (eventProcessor) is eventHandler of Shape</b> would
      have sufficed by itself.
    </p>
    <pre>...
  defines program

    ExampleDriver1()
      stdout <- Stdout()
      stdout.println("Driver for generic event handler")
      eventProcessor <- ShapeEventProcessor()

      //This is not allowed because eventHandler is constrained to Shape
      //textHandler <- (eventProcessor) is eventHandler of Text

      //Setup some event handlers and an example
      //Process through 'Shape'
      shapeHandler <- (eventProcessor) is eventHandler of Shape as function
        eventProcessor.processShapeEvent(shape)

      //Now type safe via generics and direct call to specific method
      circleHandler <- (eventProcessor) is eventHandler of Circle as function
        //Note strict typing means method 'roundness' is accessible.
        Stdout().println("Roundness " + $shape.roundness())
        eventProcessor.processCircleEvent(shape)

      //While handler is specific to Square can still call via processShapeEvent
      squareHandler <- (eventProcessor) is eventHandler of Square as function
        eventProcessor.processShapeEvent(shape)

      //make some calls on the event handlers
      shapeHandler(Circle())
      shapeHandler(Square())

      circleHandler(Circle())
      squareHandler(Square())

      //Will not compile - which is correct!
      //circleHandler(Square())
      //squareHandler(Circle())
...</pre>
    <br/>
    <p>
      The <b>circleHandler</b> and <b>squareHandler</b> have been created to again demonstrate strong
      <b>typing</b>. As shown above <b>shapeHandler</b> can be used with anything that is compatible with
      'Shape'. When incompatible <b>types</b> are used with the other handlers, the compiler will issue errors.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <b>ShapeEventProcessor</b> is now shown below.
    </p>
    <pre>...
  defines class
    //non-generic processor
    ShapeEventProcessor
      stdout as Stdout: Stdout()

      processShapeEvent()
        -> shape as Shape
        assert shape?
        stdout.println("Processed shape [" + shape.description() + "]")

      processCircleEvent()
        -> circle as Circle
        assert circle?
        stdout.println("Processed circle [" + circle.description() + " roundness " + $circle.roundness() + "]")
... </pre>
    <br/>
    <p>
      The <b>shapeHandler</b> can only call the <i>method</i> 'processShapeEvent' as it only has access to
      the 'Shape' type. Whereas the <b>circleHandler</b> has access to the 'Circle' <b>type</b> and so can
      access <i>methods</i> on the 'Circle' and call <i>method</i> 'processCircleEvent'.
    </p>
    <p>
      The output of the ExampleDriver1 <i>program</i> is shown below:
    </p>
    <pre>
Driver for generic event handler
Processed shape [Circle]
Processed shape [Square]
Roundness 0.0
Processed circle [Circle roundness 0.0]
Processed shape [Square]</pre>
    <br/>
    <p>
      The different event handlers have been defined to demonstrate type safety and flexibility.
    </p>
    <h3>Example 2</h3>
    <p>
      This second example is simpler in many ways and redefines <b>ShapeEventProcessor</b> to be
      just generic.
    </p>
    <pre>...
  defines program

     ExampleDriver2()
      stdout <- Stdout()
      stdout.println("Driver for generic event handler and generic processor")

      eventProcessor as GenericShapeEventProcessor of Shape: GenericShapeEventProcessor()

      shapeHandler <- (eventProcessor) is eventHandler of Shape as function
        eventProcessor.processShapeEvent(shape)

      //make some calls on the event handler
      shapeHandler(Circle())
      shapeHandler(Square())

  defines class

    GenericShapeEventProcessor of type T constrain by Shape
      stdout as Stdout: Stdout()

      processShapeEvent()
        -> shape as T
        assert shape?
        stdout.println("Processed shape [" + shape.description() + "]")
... </pre>
    <br/>
    <p>
      The output of ExampleDriver2 is shown below:
    </p>
    <pre>
Driver for generic event handler and generic processor
Processed shape [Circle]
Processed shape [Square]</pre>
    <br/>
    <p>
      Probably the most significant part of this example is the definition and use of the generic <i>class</i>
      <b>GenericShapeEventProcessor</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The line:
    </p>
    <div class="highlight ek9-code">
      <ul class="code-lines">
        <li>
          <span class="m">eventProcessor</span>
          <span class="k">as</span>
          <span class="m">GenericShapeEventProcessor</span>
          <span class="k">of</span>
          <span class="m">Shape</span>
          <span class="k">:</span>
          <span class="m">GenericShapeEventProcessor()</span>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <p>
      <b>GenericShapeEventProcessor</b> parameterizes <b>GenericShapeEventProcessor</b> with <b>type</b> 'Shape' and declares a variable
      of that resulting <b>type</b> and initialises it with a new instance.
    </p>
    <p>
      As in the previous example this <b>eventProcessor</b> is captured by the <i>dynamic function</i>
      <b>shapeHandler</b> and used in the function body.
    </p>
    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>
      Generics/Templates (Parametric polymorphism) provides a sophisticated mechanism to create the same
      set of code instructions on a per <b>type</b> basis. They are ideal for 'collections' but also
      for generic processing irrespective of <b>type</b>. Where <b>type</b> does become important;
      they can be made 'less generic'.
    </p>
    <p>
      Importantly they are 'type safe'; meaning that a 'List of Circle' can only contain Objects that
      are compatible with the 'Circle' <b>type</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Writing Generic/Templated code a quite a bit more complex than standard code. It takes quite a bt of time
      and focus.
    </p>
    <h4>Next Steps</h4>
    <p>
      The next section on <a href="textProperties.html">Text Properties</a> is a little lighter.
      It just enables the encapsulation of 'text' and String interpolation in a form
      similar to 'property files', but with compiler support.
