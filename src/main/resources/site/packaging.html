      <h1>Packaging in EK9</h1>
    </header>
    <p>
      This section will discuss the <i>package</i> <b>construct</b> in more detail.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <i>package</i> construct is a flexible and gradual way to control what your programs will consist of.
      It is a little like the <b>pom.xml</b> in <b>maven</b>, but with a more gradual approach to creating a
      <u>project model</u>.
      <br/>
      It does not matter if you don't know what a <b>pom</b> is or the <b>npm</b> -
      <b>package.json</b>. In short they are both mechanisms to help with packaging your software in some form or other,
      and also pulling in other packages you may need..
    </p>
    <h3>The problem we are attempting to solve</h3>
    <p>
      If you've only ever done small scale development or very limited applications/system utilities you're
      probably wondering what problem we are attempting to solve here with <i>packages</i>. In fact if you are
      still only doing small scale local development just for yourself - you don't even need to use packages.
    </p>
    <h4>What makes up your whole program</h4>
    <p>
      The first issue <i>package</i> aims to solve, is the way to describe what source files should be
      included for compilation. Clearly with EK9 it is possible to put all your source in one
      file and just compile that.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you've looked at the examples, you can see you can actually get quite a long way with that approach.
      But in time you will probably want to break the code up in to several files. Hopefully you will use different
      <i>module</i> <b>name spaces</b> to give the code more structure.
      <br/>
      This is a matter of taste, practice, experience, tooling - it's very easy to go from one extreme to another.
    </p>
    <h4>Which files to compile</h4>
    <p>
      So now we have our <u>first issue</u>, which files do we need to compile?
    </p>
    <p>
      Depending on your approach to software development; you may start of with a 'grand plan' and fill in the
      blanks (i.e. you see the big picture and do lots of structure up front).
      <br/>
      Alternatively you may just 'start coding' and see where it takes you! With the EK9 language you can take either approach.
    </p>
    <p>
      Personally I prefer the latter, creating prototypes, pulling bits from here and there, refactoring, duplicating and then
      resolving duplications. So I tend to take a very dynamic and fluid approach to development and like to
      develop 'unit tests' to exercise the code written (sometimes before it is written).
      The EK9 <i>package</i> has been developed in a staged manner to support this approach.
    </p>
    <p id="single_file">
      By default the EK9 compiler will <b>just compile the single file</b> you gave it on the command like.
      Normally this will have at least one program you want to run - but not always.
    </p>
    <p>
      But if there are multiple files that are needed. This is where the <i>package</i> <b>construct</b> starts to be useful.
      It enables the developer to 'list' the files they want to compile, as shown below.
    </p>
    <h5 id="list_of_files">Define the list of files to be compiled</h5>
    <p>
      Assumes the content below is stored in a file called <i>ConstantRef1.ek9</i>. This is a bit like a
      'Makefile' used by other languages like 'C' and 'C++' for example.
    </p>
    <pre>#!ek9
defines module introduction

  defines package

    description <- "Example of different constants in different modules."

    //We only want this file and these three to be compiled up.
    includeFiles <- [
      "ConstantRef2.ek9",
      "ConstantRef3.ek9",
      "ConstantRef4.ek9"
      ]
      ...
//EOF</pre>
    <br/>
    <p>
      Now for projects that require just a few source files this approach is quite suitable, it has enabled
      the developer to take a simple application with one source file, refactor it (over a period of time).
      Adding features and capabilities and then break those features and capabilities up and use a small number
      of related source files. This approach might work for a handful of source files, but it soon becomes a
      burden to remember to add in the new source code files you have created.
    </p>
    <p>
      This approach is really aimed at small utility programs and tools that are really just a bit too big
      for a single source file. Maybe there are some reusable elements needed by several little utilities and
      some <b>constructs</b> need to be shared.
    </p>
    <h5 id="all_files">Just include all EK9 source files</h5>
    <p>
      Once your project gets to a certain size, you will probably have it all in a directory on the filesystem
      that is dedicated just to that project. Smaller separate applications might have all been stored together
      but were actually separate and shared very little. But now you've reached the point where you want a
      dedicated directory for all the related source code. Moreover you want subdirectories for specific
      code that are best stored near each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      You now need to make a slight modification to your <i>package</i> construct. You will be relieved to know
      that you can stop listing all the source files now in the <i>includeFiles</i> directive. Now you can just
      write the following:
    </p>
    <pre>#!ek9
defines module introduction
  defines package

    description <- "Example of different constants in different modules."

    //No need for includeFiles for source code anymore.
    applyStandardIncludes <- true
    ...
//EOF</pre>
    <br/>
    <p>
      This single directive above means that any and all files that have the <b>.ek9</b> file suffix
      will now be included in the compilation build. This applies to the current directory where the source file
      with the <i>package</i> directive is and all sub directories (though not quite true) it will exclude all
      files in sub directories of <b>/dev</b> unless the type of compilation is a <b>development</b> build.
      The different types of build will be discussed later.
    </p>
    <p>
      You may ask, why not just do this as the default. The main reason is 'different use cases'.
      Sometimes you just want to knock up a quick utility (maybe a single source file). Why mess about
      with <i>package</i> when a simple <i>program</i> and a couple of <i>functions</i> are all that is
      needed? See <a href="introduction.html#purpose">EK9 purpose</a> for more details on this reasoning,
      EK9 is trying to make easy things 'easy' and hard things possible and 'fairly easy'.
    </p>
    <p>
      This 'directory' based approach with <u>special</u> named subdirectories is more the like 'maven' or
      'gradle' approach. At this point all your code only uses the standard libraries shipped with EK9 and as such
      has no external 'dependencies'. Those 'dependencies' and 'libraries' are the subject of the next paragraph.
    </p>
    <h4 id="libraries">What about libraries</h4>
    <p>
      This is the <u>second issue</u> developers face; in general you won't want or need to write all the code for your
      application yourself or even with your team. You will probably find someone else has written code
      that you would find useful. That code will most probably have been made available by that developer
      (or developers) in the <a target="_blank" title="Code Repository" href="https://repo.ek9lang.org">EK9 repository</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Conversely, maybe you've developed a number of <b>constructs</b> and what to package those up as a
      reusable library and make that available either within your own development group/company or to everyone
      via opensource.
    </p>
    <p>
      You must now update your <i>package</i> directive again to state what libraries (dependencies) you need
      included in your project.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now if the developers of those dependencies are the sort of developers that
      really want you to use their packages - they will have probably provided lots of sample code in the
      <b>/dev</b> directory. Take a look in your library <b>$HOME/.ek9/lib/{package-name}/dev</b>. There should be some
      good examples of how the developer intended you to use the package they have provided.
      <br/>
      You'd expect quite a few tests and examples to be located in the <b>dev/</b> directory with lots of documentation in
      the source code. These examples and snippets should really help you get started with how you use that library.
    </p>
    <h5>Defining dependencies</h5>
    <pre>#!ek9
defines module introduction

  defines package

    description <- "Example of different constants in different modules."

    //No need for includeFiles for source code anymore.
    applyStandardIncludes <- true

    deps <- {
      "ekopen.network.support.utils": "1.6.1-9",
      "ekopen.net.handy.tools": "3.2.1-0"
      }
      ...
//EOF</pre>
    <br/>
    <p>
      In the above example we have declared that our project has two dependencies. Also note that
      we have declared the specific version of the dependency. EK9 will also bring in any
      <i>transitive dependencies</i>. EK9 is very strict on both dependency naming and
      version numbering.
      <br/>
      There is more in the dependency naming and the version numbering in later paragraphs.
    </p>
    <h3>Dependencies and Libraries</h3>
    <p>
      If you want to use or publish packages of <b>constructs</b> then the issue of version numbering and
      dependency naming has to be addressed.
    </p>
    <h4 id="dep_name_version">Dependency Naming and Version Numbers</h4>
    <p>
      There are two main spaces for deploying modules in the EK9 repository.
    </p>
    <h5>Wild West</h5>
    <p>
      The naming of public modules in the 'ekopen' space is a 'free for all', first come first served, no
      corporates that can't mix it with freelance devs. No legal cases, no complaints, whoever gets there first
      gets the name space. But they must have a depth of at least four parts
      i.e <b>ekopen.network.support.utils</b>. The developer that issues the first package to
      <b>ekopen.network.support</b> then controls all the final module names under that space. They can publish
      and deploy as many modules under that space as they like and only they can do this.
    </p>
    <h5>Civilisation</h5>
    <p>
      This is the naming of public modules where there is a link to a controlled <b>DNS domain</b>.
      This is controlled so that individuals or corporate entities can publish packages with their associated
      name. For example only the entity that controls the <i>ek9lang.org</i> domain name can publish a package like
      <b>org.ek9lang.core.functions</b>. The mechanism of domain validation is a standard one.
      The developer wishing to publish to a controlled space like this has to create a suitable TXT DNS entry.
      The EK9 repository will then check that and that developer will be able publish to that name space.
    </p>

    <h4>In Summary</h4>
    <p>
      If you are or represent a corporate entity stay in <i>Civilisation</i>, do not stray into the
      <i>Wild West</i>. In <i>Civilisation</i> you will be able to retain control of your corporate brand naming
      and main package names and module names. If you are a developer in the <i>Wild West</i> and like the
      free for all - then don't complain about naming clashes - that's what it is like. If you don't like it;
      register a DNS domain with some provider and use <i>Civilisation</i>.
    </p>

    <h4 id="version_numbering">Version Numbering</h4>
    <p>
      Version number are the <u>third issue</u> developers face; EK9 uses a form of strict <u>Semantic Versioning</u> as follows:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH-BUILD</b></li>
      <li>For features <b>MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH-FEATURE-BUILD</b></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      There are no other
      supported variations. See <a href="commandline.html#features">features</a> for more information on why
      you might want a <u>feature name</u> in your version number.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Each time an attempt is made to build a version the build number is incremented</li>
      <li>Each time a new patch is released for a MAJOR.MINOR version the patch number is incremented</li>
      <li>Each time a new minor version is released for a MAJOR version the minor number is incremented</li>
      <li>Each time a change is made to the public interface of the package the major number is incremented</li>
    </ul>
    <h5>The Public Interface</h5>
    <p>
      All constructs defined in the packaged module name <b>are</b> the public interface. So as an example:
      Using <b>ekopen.net.handy.tools</b> in the example above, if <i>class</i> <b>CRC</b> and <i>function</i>
      <b>reverse</b> were defined in <i>module</i> <b>ekopen.net.handy.tools</b>; then they would <b>be</b>
      the <u>public interface</u>.
      <br/>
      If you wished to retain the same <b>major</b> version number - <u>it is not possible</u> to alter these
      constructs or their parameters in any way. Moreover no other <b>non public interface</b> <i>constructs</i> can be
      used as parameters into or out of that public interface. Any transitive dependencies that the
      module pulled in must also be major version compatible.
    </p>
    <p>
      This may appear overly strict or draconian, but it is necessary to ensure dependency consistency. A developer
      needs to be assured that version <b>4.5.6-21</b> can be used in place of <b>4.4.1-9</b> and that not only
      will the public code interface be the same but also the transitive dependencies will also remain major version
      compatible.
    </p>
    <p>
      So in summary:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The <b>build number</b> changes just when builds fail and you need to fix up a few minor things before
        the next patch release can go out
      </li>
      <li>A new <b>patch number</b> when a bug has been found and fixed
      </li>
      <li>A new <b>minor release number</b> when you add capabilities but the public interfaces (and transitive dependencies) have remained
        the same (i.e. better performance, alternative algorithm, newly implemented functionality that was stubbed
        in previous release (even though public interface was there)
      </li>
      <li>
        Finally, the <b>major version number</b> is incremented when there are alterations to public interface
        or use of transitive dependencies are altered (from their current major release number)
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    </p>
    <h3 id="dep_exclusions">Dependency Exclusions</h3>
    <p>
      There will come a time when a <i>transitive dependency</i> (the <u>fourth issue</u> developers face) is pulled in
      and it has known defects; you need to avoid that specific buggy version. You can use the directive below to be explicit about excluding a
      dependency when it has been pulled in.
    </p>
    <pre>#!ek9
defines module introduction

  defines package

    description <- "Example of different constants in different modules."

    //No need for includeFiles for source code anymore.
    applyStandardIncludes <- true

    deps <- {
      "ekopen.network.support.utils": "1.6.1-9",
      "ekopen.net.handy.tools": "3.2.1-0"
      }

    excludeDeps <- {
      "ekopen.some.bad.dependency.pack": "ekopen.org.supertools.util"
      }
      ...
//EOF</pre>
    <br/>
    <p>
      As you can see above the directive is very simple, it is just a dictionary (map) of dependency names. The
      above statement means: "exclude dependency 'ekopen.some.bad.dependency.pack' when it has been pulled in as
      a transitive dependency from 'ekopen.org.supertools.util'". It does not have to be a direct transitive
      dependency it could be a dependency of a dependency etc.
    </p>

    <h3 id="my_version">Version Numbers for the module and program you are developing</h3>
    <p>
      In general, if/when the software you are developing has become more than just a bit of tooling for yourself; and
      other users are now using it you will probably want to give your software a <b>version number</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
      This becomes critical for managing releases/defect/improvements - your customers or people that just use
      your software will want to know <i>when's the next release</i>. Will version x.y.z have this feature or
      that feature.
      <br/>
      The <b>version</b> directive is now added to the package declaration, but you should probably align this with
      some sort of source code repository like <a target="_blank" title="GIT" href="https://git-scm.com">git</a> or something like that.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now add in your <b>version</b> number, as shown below we've decided this version is <b>2.3.14-0</b>. Now each time
      you build, patch, make minor improvements or major improvements you must alter the release number.
      <br/>
      But don't worry the EK9 compiler can be used to automate that - so there is no need to do it by hand.
    </p>
    <pre>#!ek9
defines module introduction

  defines package

    version <- 2.3.14-0

    description <- "Example of different constants in different modules."

    //No need for includeFiles for source code anymore.
    applyStandardIncludes <- true

    deps <- {
      "ekopen.network.support.utils": "1.6.1-9",
      "ekopen.net.handy.tools": "3.2.1-0"
      }

    excludeDeps <- {
      "ekopen.some.bad.dependency.pack": "ekopen.org.supertools.util"
      }
      ...
//EOF</pre>
    <br/>
    <p>
      Now maybe you're thinking it's going to be a pain altering that version number all the time. EK9 has a mechanism
      to deal with that for you. Once you've put a version number in the EK9 compiler can alter that for you as part
      of a <u>build pipeline</u>.
      <br/>
      In general when you get to the point of supplying your software to others, you need
      a reliable/repeatable and controlled build mechanism (rather than just building it on your local PC!).
    </p>
    <p>
      By using something like
      <a target="_blank" title="GitHub Actions" href="https://github.com/features/actions">GitHub Actions</a>,
      <a target="_blank" title="AWS code pipeline" href="https://aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/">AWS</a>,
      <a target="_blank" title="Azure code pipeline" href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/services/devops/pipelines/">Azure</a>
      or <a target="_blank" title="Jenkins" href="https://www.eclipse.org/hudson/">Hudson/Jenkins</a> you can define phases of a build - and this
      can include alterations to the version being built. See the <a href="commandline.html">command line</a> for
      details on the command line options for updating the version number.
    </p>

    <h3 id="publishing">Publishing an open source module</h3>
    <p>
      You may feel that the code you've developed, either just a range of <i>functions</i>, <i>classes</i>
      or other <b>constructs</b> could be useful to other people. You may already have a git repository with
      the code on and may other developers have contributed to that. Now you want to make specific versions
      available via the EK9 repository.
    </p>
    <p>
      As mentioned earlier - decide <b>Wild West</b> or <b>Civilisation</b> and name your module accordingly.
      But now we need to add a couple more directives (as well as naming the module to be unique).
    </p>

      By adding in the <b>tags</b> the packaged module will be searchable (the <u>fifth issue developers face</u> - how to easily find useful stuff)
      and by adding <b>publicAccess</b> it has been made public to the open source community.
      We've also stated what license the software is. By using the directive <b>applyStandardExcludes</b> we can exclude
      specific files. You will probably have noticed the the <b>includeFiles</b> has been reintroduced; this in conjunction with
      <b>applyStandardIncludes</b> will ensure that all <b>ek9</b> source code in addition to those three files
      all get packaged.
    </p>
    <p>
      By changing the name of the module to <b>ekopen.math.simple.constants</b>
      (assuming <b>ekopen.math.simple</b> is still available) the software <u>can</u> now be packaged and uploaded
      to the EK9 repository. As the developer(s) that now own <b>ekopen.math.simple</b> you can publish any
      number of packages to under that structure. No other developers can publish with that module naming.
    </p>
    <p>
      It's the same process if you use and control a domain name, only your development team can publish to
      that module name.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Importantly</b> once a version of a module is published - that's it; it cannot be retracted/deleted or
      altered (other than publishing a new version). Others may now have referenced it and if you could retract
      the software you would break their builds.
    </p>
    <h4>How to publish</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>First, follow the steps above to get your code to the point where it <u>could</u> be published</li>
      <li>Check with the EK9 repository to make sure that module name is available still</li>
      <li>Signup for an account with the EK9 repository, save your credentials</li>
      <li>Use the <i>ek9</i> <a href="commandline.html#publishing">command line</a> compiler tool to publish.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Publishing to a EK9 public repository is not instant - the content being published must be scanned for viruses
      and also ensure it means the minimum standards (i.e. size, minimal/acceptable profanities). Note that when they
      are published the EK9 server will also compile them to check they will actually compile.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are a number of stages and steps the 'repository' will take to ensure that the code provided is safe and meets
      and number of basic standards.
    </p>

    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <p>
      Hopefully you will have seen how you can easily progress from small programs in single EK9 source files,
      through to medium, large and very large suites of software. These start of simply; but can have dependencies
      added and can themselves be wrapped up and published. Each aspect of this just requires the progression of
      augmenting the <i>package</i> <b>construct</b> with a little more detail as your applications/projects
      grow for small simple programs through to large modules/applications.
