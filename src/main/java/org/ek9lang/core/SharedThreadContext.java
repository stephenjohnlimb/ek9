 * We need a range of objects structures that are not synchronized (so access is quick)
 * so we want a thread to effectively own the whole tree of data when it accesses it.
 * This has been modeled on the 'Consumer' so hand your data over and then call 'accept' on this
 * object with your own consumer, and you'll get data back (don't hold references to it).
 * Keep it protected within this context.
