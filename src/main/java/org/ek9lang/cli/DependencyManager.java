/**
 * Designed to deal with managing dependencies of ek9 modules.
 * So when an ek9 module is defined and packaged it can reference dependencies and
 * development dependencies. These are basically a mix of both the module name and a version number.
 * Note that the module scope package IS public interface to your package, if you want internal,
 * implementations constructs put them in a module under the module you are packaging.
 * For example if publishing/packaging ek9open.google.tools.networking, and you want to have
 * internal stuff that can only be used inside the package then use:
 * ek9open.google.tools.networking.internal or ek9open.google.tools.networking.utils etc.
 * Full vector could be 'ek9open.google.tools.networking.utils-1.0.8-5'
 * module '-' MAJOR '.' MINOR '.' PATCH '-' BUILD
 * For feature branch builds it might be 'ek9open.google.tools.networking.utils-1.0.8-VSTS9889-5'
 * module '-' MAJOR '.' MINOR '.' PATCH ('-' FEATURE)? '-' BUILD
 * The actual artefact would have a suffix of '.zip'
 * So what's the big issue here, well we need to:
 * 1. Prohibit and detect circular dependencies.
 * 2. Remove dependencies that the developer does not want to include that other dependencies
 * might pull in.
 * 3. Ensure only a single version (highest based on version numbering) is included.
 * 4. For semanticVersioning - fail build if major version gets pulled up when other dependencies
 * need lower version.
 * For semantic versioning major > minor > patch > build and patch without feature is higher.
 * Features are ordered by alpha. i.e. Alpha > Beta for example.
 * This is done with a directed graph with back pointers back up the graph tree.
 * The main Nodes in the graph hold both the moduleName and the Version separately and have a flag
 * to denote rejection. They also hold a list of other Nodes that they depend on.
 * Once you have checked for circular dependencies (and there are none)
 * You can then use or reject exclude modules.
 * Then use this method so that modules that are the same but different version numbers can be
 * rationalised. This means finding the module of the same name but the highest version
 * (that has not already been rejected). Only keep the highest none rejected version, mark others
 * as rejected.
 * BUT NOTE this sometimes means additional dependencies get included because we might have
 * rejected a module that had a number of dependencies that only that version of the module used!
 * At the end it is possible the developer excluded a set of dependencies that were needed.
 * The compiler will let the developer know because there will be missing symbols.
