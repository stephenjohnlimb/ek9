/**

 * The 'SymbolFactory' and 'AggregateFactory' are the primary sources of new Symbols or additions to
 * exiting symbols. There are also other classes like 'ResolveOrDefineExplicitParameterizedType' that
 * take generic types and parameters and create new parameterised types.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * So this package is mainly focussed on creation of symbols and validation (to some extent).
