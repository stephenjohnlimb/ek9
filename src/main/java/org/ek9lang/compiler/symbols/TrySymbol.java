 * EK9 try statement - this can effectively return a value if it is configured with returning part.

 * from later scopes.
 * So as we have a returning part (optional) we need a scope to put it in (i.e. this scope) this
 * then means that when we use the catch and finally parts of the try we can find that returning
 * variable.
