/**
 * This stack object is only designed to be used when first parsing.
 * The idea is to actually associate the scope with the specific contexts by
 * putting them in a ParseTreeProperty of Scope, this tree is held in the
 * ParsedModule. So why do we need this stack? That is because as we
 * listen/visit the parse tree we need to both create the scope and record it in
 * the parsed module. But also put it on to a stack so that when we return for
 * each level of the parse tree we can get back to the right scope. I don't want
 * to use a 'getEnclosingScope' method on each scope as the very top level has
 * to be thread safe. Plus it exposes information that should only be available
 * to the scope itself - not any other bit of code.
