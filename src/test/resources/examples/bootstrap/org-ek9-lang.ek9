#!ek9
<!-
  Designed for testing of Generics and polymorphic parameterization.
  But this uses the full compiler - to check out the mechanism rather than
  the other generic types that work at a much lower level. Those have been hard to work
  with and have not really had the effect in finding issues that I expected.

  This has to have quite a few 'stub' types so that the basics in the Java code can use specific known EK9 types.
