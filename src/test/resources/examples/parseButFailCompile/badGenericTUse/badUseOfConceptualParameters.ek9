      Define another generic function, but it uses another generic function and parameterizes it with
      one of its conceptual parameters.
      The problem here is that the dynamic function has been taken out of the scope hierarchy and so
      as it has moved to module scope level - it cannot 'see' any of the 'types'.
      Perhaps the dynamic function/type should be able to ask it's outermost scope (if it is generic)
      to resolve those type parameters (but just those type parameters).
