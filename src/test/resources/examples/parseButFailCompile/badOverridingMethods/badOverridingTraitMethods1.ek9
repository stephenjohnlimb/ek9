      Introduce another new signature with with also an implementation.

      someMethod()

        <- rtn as String: arg0

    <?-
      Now we have a trait that has the same signature but defined multiple times,
      Two are concrete with implementations but the third is the original T1 with is abstract.
      But this is still just an interface in many ways, only when it is used should we force the
      ek9 developer to override the 'someMethod' and decide which implementation is to be used.
      Or should we force it at this point of time, there are two concrete implementation choices
      available.
