#!ek9
<?-
  Simple examples of expressions via constructs that are not normally expressions.
  So simple cases of switch, try, for-loop, do-while and while.
  Traditionally these are not expressions but with EK9 they can be.
  So this is a simple set of examples that demonstrate this.

  Also need uninitialised returns for try expressions for expressions and while do/while expressions.
  //TODO add these to usedBeforeInitialised tests.

  //TODO check control is a Boolean / also do this for 'if' statements. Do this at full resolution (new test)
