<?-
  Tests for calling operators within a pure context.
  See other tests for general operator calls, outside of a pure context.

  TODO below in another test that checks access via records, classes in simple and chained ways.
  TODO create a delegate to a pure function and a non-pure function.
  TODO access that delegate from pure and non-pure context
  TODO also have a pure/non pure delegate as property and check via method/delegate chain
  TODO from pure and non-pure context.

  Its almost like the access to a delegate needs to check the underlying 'function type' to see if it is pure.
