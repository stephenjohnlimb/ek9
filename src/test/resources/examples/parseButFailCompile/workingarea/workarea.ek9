  Workpad, next bit.
  No need to check for duplicated types, because badDuplicateConstructs.ek9 has that covered in SYMBOL_DEFINITION.
  Also there are checks on methods and variables both colliding with function names in EXPLICIT_TYPE_SYMBOL_DEFINITION.

  This just needs to focus on resolution from within a class.
  So now the only thing is to be able to resolve if it is:
  1. function delegate local variable
  2. function delegate as a property
  3. method on this class
  4. method on super
  5. method on trait.

  But there is now no ambiguity as to whether is it a function - because that would be an error detected earlier (as a name collision)
