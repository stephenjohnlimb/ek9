  Starting work on the mammoth task of streams.
  These are the main parts, note the statement does not return anything (i.e. must end in an output to something)
  But the expression form of streams does 'return something', could be a collection, or in a reduction just an instance of type.

  Main two constructions: streamStatement, streamExpression:
  Both begin with: streamSource - which can be one of either: streamCat, streamFor:
  Stream statements then have: streamPart(s)/streamStatementTermination - pipelinePart
  But Stream expressions have streamPart(s) - pipelinePart and finally: streamExpressionTermination

  The main phased approach in the definition phase is to build the 'structure' of the pipeline.
  The next phase (in order) is to workout the types, this can only be completed during phase 3 due to type inference.
  The tricky bit is ensuring that the types that flow through the pipeline align with outputs to inputs.
  This is made more complex by some pipeline parts being able to accept 'anything' and output the same type.

  So the processing is strict at the start and the end (in terms of types) and also strict when any functions are employed.
  But more flexible for things like 'skipping', 'head', 'tail' for example.
  Then for some operations like 'flatten', there has to be some way to 'iterate' over the type to get the 'flattened values'.

  The 'sort' accepts any 'T' and if used without a function expects the 'T' to have a comparator method. If it is used with a function
  then that function must accept two arguments of 'T' and return an Integer (i.e. be a comparator.)

  Operations like 'uniq' will require operators on the type - like 'hashCode' for example, unless used with a Function - then that function has to be
  able to accept a type that is compatible with the pipeline type and return an Integer (the hashcode).

  Now 'head', 'tail' and 'skip' work without any arguments and default to '1' in that case. Or they can be used with a fixed value such
  as 2, 6 or 22 - whatever. Now they can also be used with a function that accepts no arguments and returns just an integer.
  Alternatively the argument could just be a variable of type integer!
  So this means that you can alter the return value from the function if you wanted to make it a dynamic - rather than a fixed value.

  But 'group' a little like 'split' accepts any 'T' and outputs a 'List of T', flatten accepts some type of 'Â§T' and if it has an iterator method outputs 'T'.
  So group can be used without a function - in that case it just uses the hashcode of the 'T' and groups based on that.
  If a Function is it must accept an argument that is compatible with the T and return a type that has a hashCode.
  So for example if you wanted to group on surname - just return that, or if you wanted to group on Date then return that.
  If you want to group on multiple fields - create a record with those fields and provide the hashcode operator in the record.
  Alternatively just calculate the Hashcode from the fields you want to group on.

  Tee is next for development.

  'tee' is a bit tricky because it must have one pipeline part that is like the streamStatementTermination
  (this must be the second one if two pipeline parts are used).

  So if there are two pipeline parts then the first must be some sort of mapping function and the second a terminal (gathering aggregate)
  this must have the pipeline operator to be able to receive the transformed pipeline type.
  But if there is just one (i.e. no intermediate transformation) then that one must be the 'terminal' with the pipeline operation.

  So, this is pretty complex stuff.
