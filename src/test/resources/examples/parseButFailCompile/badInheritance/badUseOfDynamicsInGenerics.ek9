<?-
  Designed to show and check good simple use of dynamic functions and classes when used
  within generic classes and functions. But also highlight and detect errors.

  This is quite tricky to get your head around as it is only when a generic class or function
  is actually parameterised does it become clear wheat should result.

  The levels of indirection/abstraction can cause confusion.
