#!ek9
<!-
  Fails in multiple ways.
  1. clashes with FailToCompile2.ek9 by referencing alpha::THE_CONSTANT - which is already references in this module
  2. the name THE_CONSTANT is referenced from two namespaces (modules) so which one wins!
  3. a constant THE_CONSTANT is also defined in this module and hence that too clashes.
  4. etc for each construct type
