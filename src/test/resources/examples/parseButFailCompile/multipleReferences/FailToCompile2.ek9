  Looks OK but duplicates the reference to alpha::THE_CONSTANT
  But also references charlie::THE_CONSTANT - which does not exist (as charlie does not exist).
  And references alpha::NO_SUCH_CONSTANT - while alpha module exists, NO_SUCH_CONSTANT doesn't
  We also try and reference something without qualifying it.
