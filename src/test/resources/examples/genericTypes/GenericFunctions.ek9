defines module net.customer.generic.functions

  //See SimpleFunction.ek9 for just normal function processing
  //This focuses on how generic functions will work.
  //i.e. a full implementation of a function but in terms of abstract types like S and T
  //You must fully implement the generic function - but then to use it you must use a dynamic function syntax filling in the type parameters.
  //Now may be it would be nice to have an abstract generic function and then use it via the dynamic mechanism to provide its implementation
  //So in that case it is just a signature really, might be good for use with generic classes that need to call out to a function 'listener'

    //Maybe this would be a nice way to define a double function
    //It does not have to be pure - but in this case it is - also it could be called anything like 'doubler' or 'doubleT' whatever
    //So in its simplest form we use T (could have been O or S) as the type then we can use normal operators
    //How do we know we can use those operators? How to we know we can use other methods on T - we need to constrain T to be at least something
    //We know something about. For time being lets just get a parse and production going then see about methods and operators.
