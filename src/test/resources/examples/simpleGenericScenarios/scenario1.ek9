<?-
  There are lots (and lots) of combinations for generics.
  The use of standard generics is in genericsUse1,
  some examples are also in genericTypes.

  This set of 'scenarios' is design to try and capture the essence of use
  without surrounding boiler plate (actually useful code).

  So these example may look like they don't accomplish much, but they are needed
  to try and exercise the compiler routines for processing.

  The scenarios focus on the definition of some form of Generic/Template and some
  simple use, that highlights - what should happen.
-?>
defines module generics.scenario.one

  defines class

    <?-
      Simple Generic/template class with a single type parameter.
    -?>
    GC of type T

      <?-
        Single operation that uses the conceptual type 'T'
        as both an incoming argument type and a return argument type.
      -?>
      operation()
        -> arg0 as T
        <- result as T: arg0

  <?-
    Some sample programs that show the use of the generic type.
    The code here does not use inference, it is fully explicit.
  -?>
  defines program

    IntegerDriver()
      g <- GC() of Integer

      echoedValue as Integer: g.operation(21)
      assert echoedValue == 21

    StringDriver()
      g <- GC() of String

      echoedValue as String: g.operation("Steve")
      assert echoedValue == "Steve"
