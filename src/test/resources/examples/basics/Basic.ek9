    Now with even just the Generic Editor in eclipse you get folding
    Add in a little text mate and a viable development environment is there.
    Note you can also plugin the faint lines from Certiv for Eclipse - very useful for indent based languages like ek9.
    OK could do all sorts with textmate to improve - but that's for someone else to do.
    This is workable especially when you expand tabs to spaces and use just two spaces
    Now with folding you can include all sorts in the same file related traits, classes and function.
    IntelliJ also works well with the EK9 textmate bundle and has faint lines out of the box.

    The EK9 LSP with VSCode is also looking very good for language help.
    As the compiler gets more complete then symbols and type hierarchies will be available.

      Again a hard limit on salaries - normally soft coded - but could be hard compiled limits like this.
      But there is no reason why configuration data could not be stored in EK9 format - pulled in - compiled and used
      on the fly!
