  These are the text properties for the model
  But they could be a call to interpolate presentation text.
  Again these go into a namespace and can be used to define the text mappings.
  So all validators in the name space module net.customer.model can be
  ${input} is the input value being validated and ${constraint} is the value it is being constrained to.
 
  So each component can be defined ‘for “language”’ i.e. for en or for en_GB etc.
  In this way the text parts can be defined in files as components but also if needs be one big file
  per language or one huge file with all languages in.
  
  Now a developer could decide not to use these text properties and use a CMS instead.
  This could be done by just using a 'component' in the ui side and then just having different implementation
  one could come here and anther could go to a CMS.

  For implementation - WelcomePageText becomes an class net.customer.WelcomePageText
  mainWelcome is just a public method with no parameters.
  The defines text has an optional "lang" so this class provides the default methods with responses.

  UiProductText -> Class and moreDetailsOn with parameter of "product as Product"

  Then `More details on ${product.name}` is processed by the compiler to be:
  "More details on " + product.name._string() (that is if the interpolation is valid)

  The compiler then creates a class that extends UiProductText (or whatever text component)
  i.e. UiProductText_en and all the methods are overridden o provide the text return.

  When the code using the 'text' states WelcomePageText("en") a check is made to ensure
  that "en" has been provided and so the actual class WelcomePageText_en can be instantiated
  and the methods called!

  In terms of validation, if 'WelcomePageText' is used as default or with "en" or "de" for example
  then all must have all methods. i.e. if you add a message to the "de" then you must also add for "en" and
  default (if that is present).

          You must put it all in quotes.
          As you can see above with welcomeMessage, EK9 will look for variable names,
          but anything in double quotes is a literal.
          In general you would probably use the 'text' mechanisms described in the section before this."
