      <h1>Dependency Injection in EK9</h1>
    </header>
    <p>
      Dependency Injection and Inversion of Control have been touched on in
      <a href="components.html">Components and Applications</a>; which includes an example that shows the separation
      between 'wiring' <i>components</i> and the 'use' of components through an <i>abstract</i> base.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <u>separation</u> of 'what' it to be used by 'when' it is used, is really the main value being
      provided by inversion of control. Dependency injection is then the mechanics of how that <u>separation</u>
      is delivered.
    </p>
    <h2>Inversion of Control</h2>
    <p>
      The <u>inversion</u> part really means that the <i>function/class/method</i> no longer 'decides'
      what object it is going to create to make a call; control is inverted by either the object being passed to the
      <i>function/class/method</i> or it being 'injected'. In both cases the <i>function/class/method</i>
      does not have 'control' of the specific type of object and also is not responsible for creating it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Polymorphism is clearly essential for this mechanism to work.
    </p>
    <p>
      Consider the following snip of code (the full definition is show later in the example); the
      <b>TimerAspect</b> class does not decide the concrete <b>type</b> of <i>Clock</i> it will be using
      for timing. In this case the <i>Clock</i> is passed into the constructor method of the <b>TimerAspect</b>.
    </p>
    <pre>...
  defines class
    TimerAspect extends Aspect
      clock as Clock?

      default private TimerAspect()

      TimerAspect()
        -> clock as Clock
        this.clock: clock
...
//EOF</pre>
    <br/>
    <p>
      It is this <i>application</i> <b>'thirdApp'</b> that has the control and decides to use <i>SystemClock</i>.
      The <b>thirdApp</b> has control, in fact in EK9 it is the <i>application</i>s that are responsible for
      making the decisions on the wiring of which <i>components</i> to use.
    </p>
    <pre>...
  defines application
    thirdApp
      register Solution3() as BaseConfiguration with aspect of TimerAspect(SystemClock())
...
//EOF</pre>
    <br/>
    <p>
      But note this is separate to <u>dependency injection</u>, nothing in the above example has been
      'injected'. Only the control has been inverted.
    </p>
    <p>
      You may consider the <b>'register'</b> syntax of <b>components</b> and <b>aspects</b> to be much more
      'wordy' than much of the other EK9 syntax see so far. This is by design, the use of components and
      application should be relatively infrequent in comparison to <b>functions, classes, traits</b> and
      <b>records</b>. So their should not be a need to create too many of these large and significant
      <b>constructs</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The syntax has been designed to reflect their size and significance.
    </p>
    <h2>Dependency Injection</h2>
    <p>
      Rather than pass the <i>component</i> into a specific <i>function/class/method</i> or <i>component</i>;
      it is possible (when using an <i>abstract</i> base <i>component</i>) to have it automatically injected.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is important to use this capability sparingly and with care; as excessive use causes 'hidden' coupling
      and limits refactoring. It is then very hard to write <b>pure</b> functions and methods.
    </p>
    <pre>...
  defines class

    LoggingAspect extends Aspect
      loggingLevel as String?

      LoggingAspect() as pure
        this("WARN")

      LoggingAspect() as pure
        -> level as String
        loggingLevel: level

      override beforeAdvice()
        -> joinPoint as JoinPoint
        <- rtn as PreparedMetaData: PreparedMetaData(joinPoint)
        //Will be injected
        logger as ILogger!
        logger.log(loggingLevel, `Before ${joinPoint.componentName()} ${joinPoint.methodName()}`)

      override afterAdvice()
        -> preparedMetaData as PreparedMetaData
        joinPoint <- preparedMetaData.joinPoint()
        //Will be injected
        logger as ILogger!
        logger.log(loggingLevel, `After ${joinPoint.componentName()} ${joinPoint.methodName()}`)

...
//EOF</pre>
    <br/>
    <p>
      In the snip above the <i>method</i> <b>beforeAdvice</b> needs to be able to log out messages.
      So one solution here would have been for the <b>LoggingAspect</b> to retain control and decide on which
      implementation of <b>ILogger</b> to use.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another alternative would have been to pass an instance of a <b>construct</b> that <i>was</i> an
      <b>ILogger</b> at the construction of the <b>LoggingAspect</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rather than use either of those solutions; the <b>LoggingAspect</b> just 'expects' an implementation
      of <b>ILogger</b> to be 'injected'. It can then go on to use the <b>log</b> <i>method</i> via the
      <b>ILogger</b> abstract <i>component</i>. The key syntax to trigger injection of a <i>component</i>
      is to use the <b>!</b> symbol after the <b>type</b> when declaring the variable.
    </p>
    <p>
      The following snip shows how a concrete implementation of the <b>ILogger</b> was made available.
    </p>
    <pre>...
  defines application

    firstApp
      register FileLogger() as ILogger
      register Solution1() as BaseConfiguration with aspect of TimerAspect(SystemClock()), LoggingAspect("DEBUG")

//EOF</pre>
    <br/>
    <p>
      As the <i>application</i> <b>firstApp</b> registers a new instance of <b>FileLogger</b> as
      the <b>ILogger</b> this makes it known to EK9 that <b>FileLogger</b> can now be injected in places
      where <b>ILogger</b> is being used.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is where EK9 will look for those references to <b>ILogger</b> and ensure that the variable
      declared is set to use the implementation provided (<b>FileLogger</b> in this case).
    </p>
    <p>
      If you've used 'Spring' before in Java, this is like a very cut down version of that (by design).
      Use this capability sparingly and with care as it can inhibit reuse.
    </p>
    <h2>Limitations</h2>
    <p>
      Only <i>components</i> can be used for dependency injection. When expecting injection to take place
      the variable declared must have a <b>type</b> that is an <i>abstract</i> base <i>component</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Best practice is to restrict the number of components used and the amount of injection employed.
      As you can see from the example above <b>logger as ILogger!</b> is hidden inside a method. This makes
      the whole class much less portable, harder to refactor, less reusable. It also means that <b>pure</b>
      cannot be employed (there is a very hidden component being injected).
    </p>
    <p>
      Use this mechanism carefully and avoid it by passing in parameters where possible.
    </p>
    <h3>So why add this feature?</h3>
    <p>
      There are times when major subsystems and components need to be wired together in different ways. The
      main bulk of code remains the same and access is via <i>traits</i> or <i>abstract</i> bases
      <i>classes/components</i>. Inversion of Control and Dependency Injection are really useful to solve that
      problem in specific situations.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other major reason is to facilitate <u>Aspect Oriented Programming</u> (but in a limited way).
      There are times when it is necessary to deal with issues in software design via what are called
      'crosscutting concerns'. These typically involve:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Logging</li>
      <li>Timing of calls</li>
      <li>Transactional boundaries</li>
      <li>Permission processing</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      There are other reasons, but those above are the main ones.
    </p>
    <h2>A Scenario</h2>
    <p>
      To explain the rationale for including Inversion of Control, Dependency Injection and Aspect Oriented
      Programming it is necessary to define a scenario.
    </p>
    <p>
      The scenario is; a 'system' is required that has a number of major components, these are as follows:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Client Record System</li>
      <li>Management Reporting System</li>
      <li>Product Purchase System</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Each of these major <i>components</i> can be constructed from several other <i>components</i>. But
      (and this is the key point), whenever any type of access to <i>methods</i> on these <i>components</i>
      takes place; that access must be 'logged'.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moreover during development and also in the 'staging' phase it is also necessary to gather some
      <u>metrics</u> on how long each <i>method</i> call took when calling <i>component</i> <i>methods</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      For a real solution it would probably be necessary to deal with 'transaction' boundaries and also limit
      user access via LDAP or something like that. For this scenario focus will be on logging and timing.
    </p>
    <p>
      As you can see - in effect you need to do the 'same thing' in terms of logging/timing on every
      <i>method</i> call on every <i>component</i>. In general, you are not concerned with the fine details of
      which <i>methods</i> or the <b>types</b> and values of <u>parameters</u>.
      This is where 'Aspects' can be used; as you just need to know that the <i>method</i> was called.
    </p>
    <p>
      In other aspect oriented programming solutions a little too much detail is given. While initially
      this seems like a good idea; it triggers to temptation be developers to alter processing in some way.
    </p>
    <p>
      This leads to defects that are very hard to identify and resolve. EK9 give the developer the minimal
      information just to be able to know a <b>method</b> was called.
    </p>
    <h2>Solutions</h2>
    <h4>Error Prone and not Scalable</h4>
    <p>
      The first solution to this (not really viable) is to ensure that some form of logger and timer is
      provisioned in some 'base class/component' and so it can then be called manually by the developer
      when defining a new <i>method</i>. Not really viable as it is error-prone and focuses on <u>Inheritance</u>.
    </p>
    <h4>Too manual, but necessary if details are needed</h4>
    <p>
      Another solution would be to employ EK9 <i>classes</i> with <i>traits</i> and use delegation. So the
      new <i>class</i> can deal with the logging/timing and then just call the delegate for the actual processing.
      This is not too bad an idea, if you really want all the parameter details and are prepared to write lots
      of boilerplate code.
    </p>
    <h4>Using Aspects</h4>
    <p>
      This final solution uses 'Aspects' and <i>components</i>, as we are not really bothered about all the
      actual parameter details on the method calls (just the fact they happened/how long they took). We can use
      the EK9 solution. This is shown below.
    </p>
    <p>
      To keep the example fairly short a single <i>component</i> that notionally holds a 'FileStoreName' as
      part of a configuration is used. It is the access to <i>methods</i> on the configuration component that need
      to be logged and in some cases timed.
    </p>
    <h4>Explanation</h4>
    <p>
      Three different <b>BaseConfiguration</b> solutions have been provided - typically they might have different
      performance characteristics, or costs, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      To use the 'wired' in <b>BaseConfiguration</b> solution; a <i>class</i> <b>ConfigHandler</b> has the
      dependency injected.
    </p>
    <p>
      A simple <i>function</i> <b>checkConfigHandler</b> is used to create a new instance of the
      <b>ConfigHandler</b> and call 'showConfigDetails()' so details can be printed out. It is this
      <i>method</i> that triggers a call to method 'getFileStoreName()' on the <i>component</i> 'wired' in.
    </p>
    <h5>The Applications</h5>
    <p>
      Four different <i>applications</i> have been defined; these are:
    </p>
    <h6>noAspectApp</h6>
    <pre>...
    noAspectApp
      register Solution1() as BaseConfiguration
...</pre>
    <br/>
    <p>
      This <i>application</i> does not do any logging or timing and uses <b>Solution1</b> as
      the <b>BaseConfiguration</b>. This <i>application</i> is then used by <i>program</i> <b>Program0</b>.
      The main point of this is just to check the functionality works! Its output is shown below:
    </p>
    <pre>
Program0 functionality
Will check config handler to see if file store name is available
MainStore
        </pre>
    <h6>firstApp</h6>
    <pre>...
    firstApp
      register FileLogger() as ILogger
      register Solution1() as BaseConfiguration with aspect of TimerAspect(SystemClock()), LoggingAspect("DEBUG")
...</pre>
    <br/>
    <p>
      <b>Solution1</b> is also used; but does use both logging and timing 'Aspects'.
      These 'Aspects' are described in detail after the example code. Its output is shown below:
    </p>
    <pre>
Program1 functionality
Will check config handler to see if file store name is available
DEBUG: Before com.customer.components.Solution1 getFileStoreName
DEBUG: After com.customer.components.Solution1 getFileStoreName
INFO: 3ms Milliseconds for com.customer.components.Solution1 getFileStoreName
MainStore
        </pre>
    <h6>secondApp</h6>
    <pre>...
    secondApp
      register FileLogger() as ILogger
      register Solution2() as BaseConfiguration with aspect of LoggingAspect("WARN")
...</pre>
    <br/>
    <p>
      <b>Solution2</b> is used in this case and only uses the logging 'Aspect'.
      Also note how the logging level has been altered to 'WARN', the <b>secondApp</b> took
      control of this when specifying the construction of the logging 'Aspect'.
      Its output is shown below:
    </p>
    <pre>
Program2 functionality
Will check config handler to see if file store name is available
WARN: Before com.customer.components.Solution2 getFileStoreName
WARN: After com.customer.components.Solution2 getFileStoreName
SecondaryStore
        </pre>
    <h6>thirdApp</h6>
    <pre>...
    thirdApp
      register FileLogger() as ILogger
      register Solution3() as BaseConfiguration with aspect of TimerAspect(SystemClock())
...</pre>
    <br/>
    <p>
      Finally this <i>application</i> uses <b>Solution3</b> and this time only uses the timer 'Aspect'.
      Its output is shown below:
    </p>
    <pre>
Program3 functionality
Will check config handler to see if file store name is available
INFO: 1ms Milliseconds for com.customer.components.Solution3 getFileStoreName
DefaultStore
        </pre>
    <h5>The Programs</h5>
    <p>
      Four different <i>programs</i> when linked with the four different applications could have different
      functionality. If the <i>applications</i> were much larger, different programs might be needed for
      a range of different tasks (all relating to the same <i>application</i>).
    </p>
    <p>
      This is one of the main points of IOC/DI; separate the 'wiring' of the application and all of its
      <i>components</i> from the <i>program</i> itself. Split the control.

    <h3>Logging</h3>
    <p>
      It would be normal to pull the <b>ILogger</b>, <b>FileLogger</b> and any other logging implementations
      out to a separate <i>module</i> and source file; as these would be widely reusable. Typically, they would
      form part of a 'core infrastructure' layer.
    </p>
    <h3>Timing/Logging Aspects</h3>
    <p>
      As you can see above, there is a dependency in the <b>TimerAspect</b> on <b>ILogger</b> and it expects
      it to be injected. You may or may not want that! In general the more decoupled things are; the better.
    </p>
    <p>
      So an alternative here would be to develop and number of logger <i>class</i> implementations and then
      pass those in to a <b>Logger</b> <i>component</i>/'Aspect' or a <b>Timer</b> 'Aspect'. Then when each of
      those is created in the appropriate <i>application</i> it can be composed with the right implementation.
    </p>
    <h3>Aspects</h3>
    <p>
      You might be wondering what's all this 'beforeAdvice', 'afterAdvice', 'JoinPoint' and 'PrepareMetaData';
      there seems to be a lot of jargon going on here! Well there is a lot of jargon in 'Aspect Oriented Programming'!
    </p>
    <h4>Advice</h4>
    <p>
      Basically; it is the two methods that get called before and after the <i>method</i> on the <i>component</i> we
      are looking to wrap an 'Aspect' around.
    </p>
    <h4>JoinPoint</h4>
    <p>
      So just before the <i>component</i> <i>method</i> is called; EK9 creates a 'JoinPoint' object and populates
      it with the <i>component</i> name and the <i>method</i> name. Then it calls 'beforeAdvice' and passes the
      'JoinPoint' object in as a parameter. Now over to you; the developer - you can do what you like here!
      But you must return an Object that is or extends 'PrepareMetaData'. See the <b>TimerData</b> as an example
      of this. You can squirrel away all sorts of data in that object you return (you might need it in the
      'afterAdvice').
    </p>
    <h4>afterAdvice and PreparedMetaData</h4>
    <p>
      When EK9 calls the 'afterAdvice', it will pass back the 'PreparedMetaData' that was returned by the
      'beforeAdvice'; if you look at the <b>TimerData</b> you can see that you now have access to the millisecond
      data of when 'beforeAdvice' was called (and also the 'JoinPoint').
      So in the case of the Timer Aspect it is possible to work out the duration of the call!
    </p>
    <h3>Benefits</h3>
    <p>
      Once you have defined a set of 'Aspects'; they can be used with <u>any</u> <i>component</i>! Yes they are
      limited to just textual representations of the <i>component</i> name and <i>method</i> name. It is not
      possible to <u>filter</u> and say you want some <i>methods</i> and not others (too fragile!). The details
      of all the parameters are not available to you. But these are reasonable limitations, anything more than
      this tends to lead to complexity, confusion and brittle code that fails when refactored.
    </p>
    <h4>Separation of Concerns</h4>
    <p>
      The separation of concerns of functionality from logging and timing is a major benefit. The same 'Aspects'
      can be used over and over again and a wide range of <i>components</i> and all their <i>methods</i>; none
      of which need to concern themselves with logging or timing. This leads to clarity and wider reuse/reliability.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clearly in this example, having just one <i>method</i> to log and time is trivial. But if you have thousands
      of <i>components/methods</i> this approach works quite well.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is also clearly a form of <i>composition</i>.
    </p>
    <h4>Inversion of Control</h4>
    <p>
      The inversion of control in terms of which <i>component</i> is now extended to include which 'Aspect'
      (if any) should be applied to that component. This is <u>one</u> of the main reasons the <i>application</i>
      <b>construct</b> was created.
    </p>
    <p>
      So in the <i>application</i> it is possible to define all the high level <i>components</i> that should be
      used. When creating those <i>components</i> the appropriate <i>classes</i> and <i>functions</i>
      can be passed into the <i>components</i> as parameters. Any <i>classes</i> or <i>functions</i> that need
      access to <i>components</i> can either have the <i>component</i> passed in as a parameter or can use
      dependency injection.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is a critical point; the <i>application</i> <b>construct</b> is only really aimed at facilitation the
      high level composition of our solution. You should strive to use inversion of control with <b>constructs</b>
      by passing in instances at construction. You should only employ <b>dependency injection</b> when you really need to.
    </p>
    <h4>Coupling</h4>
    <p>
      <i>class</i> <b>ConfigHandler</b> remains unchanged and not linked directly to any concrete implementation.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is easy to alter if/how/where logging is done without needing to alter any code relating to the actual
      functionality in the <i>components</i>.
    </p>
    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <p>
      In general it is only when software gets to a certain size that IOC/Di becomes necessary. Employing
      'Aspects' can be useful in a limited number of scenarios. But when comprehensive logging, security or
      other 'crosscutting concerns' are critical across a large number of <i>components</i> they really help
      reduce boilerplate code.
    </p>
    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>
      If you've used Spring or 'AspectJ' with the Java language, you'll probably consider what is included in EK9
      as <u>inadequate</u>. The design of EK9 has been done in such a way as to curtail/reduce the extreme
      use of IOC/DI and Aspect Oriented programming. Some developers may consider this a bad thing. They
      may consider that developers should have the freedom to do what they want.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can - but not in EK9; use Java and Spring as this may meet your needs.
    </p>
    <p>
      The EK9 language is opinionated and provides more functionality in some areas and less in others, this is
      borne of experience and having to deal with nightmares of injection, tight coupling and hidden dependencies.
