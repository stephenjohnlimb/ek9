      <h1>Command Line in EK9</h1>
    </header>
    <p>
      This last section will discuss the <i>command line</i> <b>options</b> of the reference implementation of
      the compiler.
    </p>
    <p>
      From a command prompt; just type <b>ek9 someSource.ek9</b> for source to be compiled and executed.
      If all you have is a single source file and want to execute it - that's it!<br/>
      But, if your ek9 source file has the 'execute' bit set on Linux, Unix and MacOs and the 'ek9' command is on your
      PATH, you can just type ./someSource.ek9 and the 'shebang of #!ek9 will trigger the use of the ek9 command.
    </p>
    <p>
      Actually the EK9 compiler can do quite a bit more than just compile source code. Read
      the section on <a href="packaging.html">packaging</a> for when you have a few sources files or thousands.
    </p>
    <h3>Is it a build system then?</h3>
    <p>
      Not quite; is probably the right answer. If you are doing a pure EK9 development then it will get you
      a very long way. It is designed to be used by other build systems, CI/CD pipelines and to fit into a larger
      build pipeline. For simple small/medium development it will probably suffice.
    </p>
    <h3>Can it be used with other build systems</h3>
    <p>
      The EK9 compiler has been designed to be usable in modern build pipelines either from other software like
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/features/actions" target="_blank" title="GitHub Actions">GitHub Actions</a>,</li>
      <li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/" target="_blank" title="AWS code pipeline">AWS</a>,</li>
      <li><a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/services/devops/pipelines/" target="_blank" title="Azure code pipeline">Azure</a>.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      So it has a number of options that don't actually compile code, but facilitate versioning and packaging.
    </p>
    <p>
      When used with the <b>'-ls'</b> flag it can also be used as a
      <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/" target="_blank" title="LSP">language server</a> with code editors like
      IntelliJ, Vim, Eclipse and VSCode. There is an extension for
      <a href="https://github.com/stephenjohnlimb/vscode-ek9-ls" target="_blank" title="EK9 for VSCode">VSCode</a> that can use EK9 in this mode, it
      also includes syntax highlighting and code snippets.
    </p>
    <h3>Why add all those options in?</h3>
    <p>
      Please read the <a href="introduction.html">introduction</a> for the logic of this. These are the basic
      operations you need to be able to produce and manage modern software.
      <br/>
      Developing software now goes way beyond just compilation. The very nature of software delivery has undergone
      enormous change. Building very large <i>monolithic</i> applications <u>must be avoided</u> if possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Packaging, version management and deployment provision are all critical aspects of creating modular
      software now.
      But also linking parts together as separate runnable modules with very specific and defined interfaces is
      the way forward.
    </p>
    <h3>Command line application</h3>
    <p>
      The reference implementation of the compiler has a wide range of options for very specific purposes, these
      are detailed below. To just run a <i>program</i> and have it automatically compiled see
      <a href="programs.html#running_example2">running programs</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      By just running the <i>ek9</i> (with no source file) like this below you will see the following options.
    </p>
    <div class="highlight ek9-code">
      <ul class="code-lines">
        <li>
          <span class="m">$</span>
          <span class="k">ek9</span>
          <span class="m">&crarr;</span>
        </li>
        <li><span class="m">Usage: ek9 &lt;options&gt;</span></li>
        <li><span class="m">where possible options include:</span></li>
        <li><span class="m">&nbsp;&nbsp;...</span></li>
        <li><span class="m">&nbsp;&nbsp;filename.ek9 - the main file to work with</span></li>
        <li><span class="m">&nbsp;&nbsp;-r Program to run (if EK9 file as more than one)</span></li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <h3>Options</h3>
    <p>
      There are a number of options that are related and these are explained in relation to each other.
    </p>
    <h5>General</h5>
    <p>
      <b>-v</b> This just output lots of information relating to what the compiler is doing.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>-V</b> This just shows the version number of the compiler itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>-h</b> A general help message for all the options available.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>-e &lt;name&gt;=&lt;value&gt;</b> Define an environment variable,<br/>
      for example <b>user=Steve</b>,<br/>
      or <b>user=\'Steve Limb\'</b> if you must have spaces.
    </p>
    <p id="target_architecture">
      <b>-T</b> target architecture - defaults to 'java' if not specified (but see <b>EK9_TARGET</b> below) -
      actually Java the only architecture supported at present!
    </p>
    <p>
      Also the environment variable <b>EK9_TARGET</b> can be used in place of <b>-T</b>. The <b>-T</b>
      optional will override the environment variable <b>EK9_TARGET</b> if used. This environment variable
      has been introduced so that it is not necessary to provide the command line parameter all the time.
    </p>
    <h4>Memory Configuration</h4>
    <p>
      EK9 provides two environment variables to control JVM memory allocation:
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>EK9_COMPILER_MEMORY</b> - Sets the maximum heap size for the EK9 compiler itself.
      Defaults to <b>-Xmx512m</b> if not set. Useful for large projects or when running multiple
      compilations in parallel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Example: <b>export EK9_COMPILER_MEMORY="-Xmx1024m"</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>EK9_APPLICATION_MEMORY</b> - Sets the maximum heap size for compiled EK9 applications
      when running them. Defaults to <b>-Xmx512m</b> if not set. Adjust this based on your
      application's memory requirements.
    </p>
    <p>
      Example: <b>export EK9_APPLICATION_MEMORY="-Xmx2048m"</b>
    </p>
    <h4>Language Server</h4>
    <p>
      The compiler can be used just as a 'language server', in this mode it does not produce
      an executable as an output; but it does complete the 'front end' phase of compilation and provides diagnostics.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is an <a href="https://github.com/stephenjohnlimb/vscode-ek9-ls" target="_blank" title="EK9 for VSCode">EK9 VSCode Extension</a>
      available as opensource, once development is complete this will be published.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>-ls</b> Use compiler as a 'Language Server' only with stdin/stdout as the protocol channel.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>-lsh</b> This flag will configure the EK9 language server so that it provides additional EK9 language hover help.
      This includes hover help for 'operators' such as <b>':=</b> for example. So is very useful when first using EK9,
      the hover help also includes hyperlinks to the appropriate sections on this site.
    </p>
    <h4 id="compilation">Compilation</h4>
    <p>
      There are a number of different options to control compilation, this gives quite fine-grained control
      over full builds versus incremental builds. What constitutes the source files is described in
      <a href="packaging.html#single_file">small applications</a>,
      <a href="packaging.html#list_of_files">medium applications</a>,
      <a href="packaging.html#all_files">large applications</a> and
      <a href="packaging.html#libraries">use of libraries</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>-c</b> Incremental compile; but don't run. Only source files that have changed get recompiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>-cg</b> As above; incremental compile but with debugging information.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>-cd</b> As above; incremental compile but with all <b>dev code</b> and debugging information.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>-Cl</b> Clean all, including dependencies.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>-C</b> Full recompile; but don't run. All source files are recompiled even if they have not changed.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>-Cg</b> As above; full recompile but with debugging information.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>-Cd</b> As above; full recompile but with all <b>dev code</b> and debugging information.
    </p>
    <h5>Dev Code</h5>
    <p>
      The idea of <b>dev code</b> is the concept of defining some source code that is not really part of your
      program/application or library; but is <u>code used as an example or for testing</u>.
      <br/>
      It can be more than just unit test code, it could be a set of worked examples, templates, <u>how-tos</u>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Basically it can be anything that another developer might find useful that is not part of the main functionality
      your software provides. So by default a user of your library (if that's what you are creating) would not use any of the
      code in your <b>/dev</b> directory in production use. But would really value real examples and tests that
      you have provided to show how your library can and should be used.
    </p>
    <p>
      So it's best to make these <b>/dev</b> code examples short, tight to the point and easy to <u>snip</u> to
      enable the developer using your library to take that snip and rework it into their application.
    </p>
    <p>
      So rather than the developer searching the internet for examples of how to use the library, include real
      examples and tests to show and help that developer get going.
    </p>
    <p>
      Integration/Unit tests, any <i>programs</i> that start with 'test' in the <b>/dev</b> directory or
      subdirectories are considered integration/unit tests (see <b>-t</b> optional later).
    </p>
    <h4 id="dependencies">Dependencies</h4>
    <p>
      <b>-Dp</b> Resolve all dependencies, this triggers <b>-Cl</b> clean all first. If you have altered the EK9 source
      file that contains the <i>package</i> <b>construct</b> and altered the dependencies this will be
      automatically run. As you can see it will trigger a <b>Clean</b> and that will mean a full recompilation
      will also be required.
    </p>
    <p>
      The resolved dependencies will be pulled down from <b>repo.ek9lang.org</b> validated and put in your
      <b>$HOME/.ek9/lib</b> directory and unpacked. So if you wanted to look at the examples, snips or tests
      the developer of that dependency provided then just look in your library! You can then lift some of those
      examples or snips from the dependency <b>/dev</b> directory into your own code and try them out.
    </p>
    <h4 id="publishing">Packaging</h4>
    <p>
      The packaging of the software for some form of reuse does not mean the software has to be 'open source'
      You can package your modules and re-use them all internally to your organisation, or even just on your own
      PC!
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>-P</b> Package ready for deployment to artefact server/library.<br/>
      You decide if the software is fit to package. I'd suggest a range of <u>unit tests</u> in the <b>/dev</b>
      area of your project.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>-I</b> Install packaged software to your local library ($HOME/.ek9/lib).
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>-Gk</b> Generate signing keys for deploying packages to an artefact server -
      only needed if publishing to a remote server.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>-D</b> Deploy packaged software to an artefact server, this triggers -P packaging first and
      -Gk if necessary. Note you will need to have an account on the remote server and also have your
      <i>$HOME/.ek9/config</i> and <i>$HOME/.ek9/credentials</i> setup for your package to be deployed.
    </p>
    <h4>Version Numbers</h4>
    <p>
      So that you can include <a href="packaging.html#version_numbering">versioning</a>
      into your other processes, such as creating new branches in your
      source code repository, triggering new builds of the software - EK9 has a number of commands to help
      alter the version number for you. The <a href="packaging.html">package</a> <b>construct</b> is essential
      for managing versioning of EK9 software.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>-IV</b> [major|minor|patch|build] - increment part of the release vector. EK9 will work out the next
      value to be used. You just decide it is major, minor, patch or just the build number to increment.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>-SV</b> major.minor.patch - force setting to specific value i.e 6.8.1-0 (always zeros build on setting).
      Useful when you want to create a new branch in your source code repository and need to ensure your code
      uses the same numbering.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>-SF</b> major.minor.patch-feature - force setting to specific value for <b>features</b>
      i.e 6.8.0-specials-0 (always zeros build on setting). As above but useful for feature branches.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>-PV</b> print out the current version i.e 6.8.1-0 or 6.8.0-specials-0 for a feature. Saves you having to
      <b>grep</b> it out!
    </p>
    <h5 id="features">Features</h5>
    <p>
      While <b>features</b> are not a unique concept to EK9 and are used very widely with <b>git</b>
      repositories - but they probably are worth a quick mention.
    </p>
    <p>
      As outlined in <a href="packaging.html#version_numbering">versioning</a> any release of software must
      have a unique version number. However, there are times when a large team need to work on the next release.
      Now the tricky bit, different groups of developers will form to work on a <u>feature</u> together.
      But there may be several <u>features</u> planned for this next release, and they all need to be worked
      on concurrently but with some form of isolation from each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is where a new set of feature branches are created, each group then work on their features in a sort
      of semi isolated manner. All striving to get their features ready for the next main build. During this time
      all the members of the team working on a <u>feature</u> work on the same code (git enables this).
      But critically they also need to run full automated builds and tests of their group effort. In some cases
      they may even need to deploy their <u>feature</u> and demonstrate it to end users, product owners or parts
      of the testing team (or even marketing departments).
    </p>
    <p>
      That software needs a version number so that any issues, new ideas, defects or alterations can be made.
      Importantly it must include some name that the teams understand i.e. <b>the feature</b>. That is why
      EK9 has a special locations in the version numbering for a <u>feature name</u>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some features never see the light of day, others are fit for purpose and get folded back into the main
      development branch. Others need more work and don't quite make the 'cut' for the next major version to be
      delivered; hence they have to go into another release scheduled later. Sometimes features are merged and
      refined further by merging <b>git feature branches</b>. EK9 supports this by enabling the version number
      to be manipulated in a controlled manner.
    </p>
    <h4>The 'run' options</h4>
    <p>
      These are really the options you care about, running your software. By default, if no options are given then
      <b>-r</b> (run) is assumed. But importantly if the source code has not been compiled yet; the EK9 compiler
      will trigger a full build - including resolving dependencies. This means you can just write (or download)
      some EK9 source and then 'run it'. First time though it will be checked and compiled, subsequently if
      nothing has been altered it will just be 'run' without recompiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>-t</b> Runs all unit tests that have been found, this triggers -Cd full compile first. To define tests
      store them in the <b>/dev</b> directory just by the main source file you reference. EK9 will find all the
      code in the <b>/dev</b> directory and compile that as well as your main source. It will then find all
      <i>programs</i> that start with 'test' (just in the /dev and subdirectories) and run them all.
      For Java guys this is a bit like junit. The test programs cannot have any command line parameters, because they
      are automated.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>-d port</b> Run in debug mode (requires debugging information to have been compiled in). The use of
      <b>edb</b> the EK9 debugger will be covered once developed.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>-r</b> Run in normal mode (assumed if no other option provided).
    </p>
    <h3 id="standard_io">Using Standard Input and Output</h3>
    <p>
      EK9 programs can read from <b>standard input</b> (stdin) and write to <b>standard output</b> (stdout),
      making them work seamlessly with Unix-style pipes and shell redirection. This is essential for creating
      <u>CLI tools</u>, <u>filters</u>, and <u>pipeline-based applications</u>.
    </p>
    <h4>Simple Example</h4>
    <p>
      Here's a minimal EK9 program that reads from stdin and writes to stdout:
    </p>
    <pre>#!ek9
defines module introduction

  defines program

    PassThrough()
      stdin &lt;- Stdin()
      stdout &lt;- Stdout()

      inputLine &lt;- stdin.next()
      stdout.println(inputLine)
//EOF</pre>
    <h4>Running with Pipes</h4>
    <p>
      Once compiled, you can use standard Unix piping to pass data to your EK9 program:
    </p>
    <div class="highlight ek9-code">
      <ul class="code-lines">
        <li>
          <span class="m">$</span>
          <span class="k">echo "Hello World" | ek9 PassThrough.ek9</span>
          <span class="m">&crarr;</span>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="m">Hello World</span>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <p>
      On Unix, Linux, and macOS systems with the shebang (<b>#!ek9</b>) and execute permissions set,
      you can run it directly:
    </p>
    <div class="highlight ek9-code">
      <ul class="code-lines">
        <li>
          <span class="m">$</span>
          <span class="k">chmod u+x PassThrough.ek9</span>
          <span class="m">&crarr;</span>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="m">$</span>
          <span class="k">echo "Hello World" | ./PassThrough.ek9</span>
          <span class="m">&crarr;</span>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="m">Hello World</span>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <h4>Chaining with Unix Tools</h4>
    <p>
      EK9 programs integrate naturally with Unix command-line tools, allowing you to build
      processing pipelines:
    </p>

    <h3 id="exit_codes">Exit Codes</h3>
    <p>
      The <b>ek9</b> command uses specific <i>exit codes</i> to enable integration with <u>shell scripts</u>,
      <b>build systems</b>, and <b>CI/CD pipelines</b>. Understanding these exit codes is essential for
      automation and error handling in production environments.
    </p>
    <h4>How Exit Codes Work</h4>
    <p>
      The <b>ek9</b> command is a wrapper that invokes the EK9 compiler (a Java program). The wrapper
      translates the compiler's internal exit codes to standard Unix conventions where <b>exit code 0</b>
      means success:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        If the compiler returns <b>internal code 0</b>: The compiler has printed a command to run your program.
        The wrapper executes that command and returns <u>whatever exit code your EK9 program returns</u>.
      </li>
      <li>
        If the compiler returns <b>internal code 1</b>: The operation completed successfully with nothing to run
        (e.g., <b>-C</b> compile only, <b>-V</b> version, <b>-Gk</b> generate keys). The wrapper maps this to
        <b>exit code 0</b> (Unix success).
      </li>
      <li>
        If the compiler returns <b>internal codes 2-10</b>: The compiler encountered an error. The wrapper
        returns the same exit code to indicate the specific failure.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Exit Codes You Will See</h4>
    <p>
      When you run the <b>ek9</b> command, you will see these exit codes following standard Unix conventions:
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>0</b> - Success. Either a successful operation completed (compilation, versioning, packaging, etc.),
      or your EK9 program executed and returned 0.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>1</b> - Cannot execute. The system was unable to run the EK9 compiler or your compiled program.
      Check that EK9 is properly installed and you have the necessary permissions. Error details are
      printed to stderr.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>2</b> - Invalid parameters. The command line parameters provided were not valid or could not be parsed.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>3</b> - File processing error. The specified file was not found, could not be read, or had missing content.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>4</b> - Invalid combination of parameters. The parameters provided were individually valid but incompatible
      when used together.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>5</b> - No programs found. The EK9 file does not contain any <i>programs</i> that can be executed.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>6</b> - Program not specified. The EK9 file contains more than one <i>program</i>, and you must specify
      which one to run using the <b>-r</b> flag.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>7</b> - Language Server failed to start. The EK9 compiler could not start in <i>Language Server Protocol</i>
      mode when using the <b>-ls</b> flag.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>8</b> - Compilation failed with errors. The EK9 source code contains syntax errors, type errors, or other
      compilation issues. Error messages will be printed to stderr.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>9</b> - Wrong number of program arguments. The <i>program</i> requires a specific number of arguments, but a
      different number was provided at runtime. This is detected during the generated code's argument validation.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>10</b> - Cannot convert argument to required type. A <i>program</i> argument could not be converted to the type
      required by the program's parameter (e.g., passing <b>"notInteger"</b> when an <b>Integer</b> is required).
      This is detected during the generated code's argument conversion.
    </p>
    <h4>Exit Codes from Your EK9 Programs</h4>
    <p>
      When you use <b>ek9 -r yourProgram.ek9</b> or <b>./yourProgram.ek9</b>, if compilation succeeds
      (compiler returns exit code 0), the wrapper executes your program and returns <u>your program's exit code</u>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your EK9 <i>programs</i> can set their own exit codes using the <b>Exception</b> <i>class</i>, which
      supports holding an exit code. If an <b>Exception</b> propagates back to the main <i>program</i> without
      being caught, the application will exit with that exception's exit code. See the
      <a href="exceptions.html">Exceptions</a> section for details.
    </p>
    <p>
      This means your EK9 programs can return <u>any exit code</u> (0 for success, non-zero for errors),
      and that exit code will be propagated through the wrapper to the shell. This is essential for
      writing <u>CLI applications</u> that work correctly in shell scripts and automation.
    </p>
    <h4>Shell Script Usage</h4>
    <p>
      In <u>shell scripts</u> and <b>CI/CD pipelines</b>, you can use standard Unix exit code patterns:
    </p>
    <div class="highlight ek9-code">
      <ul class="code-lines">
        <li>
          <span class="m">$</span>
          <span class="k">ek9 -C myprogram.ek9</span>
          <span class="m">&crarr;</span>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="m">$</span>
          <span class="k">if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then</span>
          <span class="m">&crarr;</span>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="m">$</span>
          <span class="k">&nbsp;&nbsp;echo "Compilation successful"</span>
          <span class="m">&crarr;</span>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="m">$</span>
          <span class="k">elif [ $? -eq 8 ]; then</span>
          <span class="m">&crarr;</span>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="m">$</span>
          <span class="k">&nbsp;&nbsp;echo "Compilation failed"</span>
          <span class="m">&crarr;</span>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="m">$</span>
          <span class="k">fi</span>
          <span class="m">&crarr;</span>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <p>
      Or use the simpler standard pattern:
    </p>
    <div class="highlight ek9-code">
      <ul class="code-lines">
        <li>
          <span class="m">$</span>
          <span class="k">if ek9 -C myprogram.ek9; then</span>
          <span class="m">&crarr;</span>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="m">$</span>
          <span class="k">&nbsp;&nbsp;echo "Success"</span>
          <span class="m">&crarr;</span>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="m">$</span>
          <span class="k">else</span>
          <span class="m">&crarr;</span>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="m">$</span>
          <span class="k">&nbsp;&nbsp;echo "Failed with exit code $?"</span>
          <span class="m">&crarr;</span>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="m">$</span>
          <span class="k">fi</span>
          <span class="m">&crarr;</span>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <h4>CI/CD Integration</h4>
    <p>
      Build systems and <b>CI/CD pipelines</b> (such as
      <a href="https://github.com/features/actions" target="_blank" title="GitHub Actions">GitHub Actions</a>,
      <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/" target="_blank" title="AWS code pipeline">AWS CodePipeline</a>, or
      <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/services/devops/pipelines/" target="_blank" title="Azure code pipeline">Azure Pipelines</a>)
      will automatically detect non-zero exit codes and mark builds as failed. Exit codes <b>8</b>, <b>9</b>, and <b>10</b>
      are particularly important for detecting compilation and runtime errors in automated builds.
    </p>
    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <p>
      There are quite a few options available with the EK9 <b>CLI</b> but in general if you just want to
      write some source and run it - very few options are actually needed. On Linux/macOS platforms just change
      the execute bit of your source file (<b>chmod u+x someSource.ek9</b>) and then just run it
      (<b>./someSource.ek9</b>) as long as you installed the EK9 <b>CLI</b> correctly the code will get compiled
      and run. On Windows you need to just type <b>ek9 someSource.ek9</b> for it to get compiled and executed.
    </p>
    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>
      Well if you got this far, <b>well done!</b> Because this is the last section.
    </p>
    <p>
      What's been attempted with EK9 is to bridge the gap between pure software development with a compiled language
      and the packaging, releasing and publishing of software. But doing it in a way that employs a fairly simple language
      structure that easy to read/write, but is performant and has a range of sophisticated software engineering design
      patterns built in.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is ambitious, difficult (technically) and very hard in terms of building the necessary human ecosystem that is
      essential to make a programming language successful.
    </p>
    <p>
      The reason the EK9 language is so large is because it incorporates language structure, new constructs,
      design patterns, API's, versioning, building, packaging and deployment. But hopefully you will find it
      can provide value for you as a developer; in layers as you need them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only time will tell if <u>we</u> can succeed. But thank you for taking the time to read these documents.
