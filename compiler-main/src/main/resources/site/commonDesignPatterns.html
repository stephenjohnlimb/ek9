      <h1>EK9 Design Patterns</h1>
    </header>
    <p>
      Many 'Design Patterns' have already been incorporated into EK9 and discussed in those sections.
      There are however, a number of common patterns that tend to be used in most programming languages.
      Some of those languages have specific features that accommodate these patterns. In some cases however,
      these features have been found to cause defects or make code very hard to understand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here are some common scenarios and some patterns that can be adopted in EK9 (and indeed in other languages).
    </p>
    <h2>Object Initialisation</h2>
    <p>
      Many Object-Oriented programming languages take the approach that an 'Object' should always be initialised
      and <b>must</b> be configured to be in a 'stable' and 'fully initialised' state before being used.
    </p>
    <p>
      While this approach is general a very good idea, it can lead to <b>constructors</b> with many arguments, or
      in some cases multiple <b>constructors</b> with varying numbers of arguments to support flexible construction.
    </p>

    <p>
      This latter point has triggered some programming languages to introduce the concept of 'default argument values',
      these tend to have to following form. (Shown below in EK9 syntax - though this is <b>not supported</b> - see alternative later)
    </p>
    <h3>Argument Passing</h3>
    <p>
      Here is an example of how default arguments would be defined in EK9 if they were supported - which they are <b>not</b>.
    </p>
    <pre>
      ...
        SomeMethodOrConstructor()
          ->
            name as String: "Steve"
            developer as Boolean: true
            dogOwner as Boolean: false
      ...
    </pre>
    <br/>
    <p>
      The code below demonstrates how this method/function/constructor above would be used in languages that
      do support 'default' argument values.
    </p>

    <pre>
      ...

      result1 <- SomeMethodOrConstructor()
      result2 <- SomeMethodOrConstructor("Stephen")
      result3 <- SomeMethodOrConstructor(false)
      result4 <- SomeMethodOrConstructor("Bill", false)
      result5 <- SomeMethodOrConstructor("Ted", false, true)

      //Some languages allow named variables, so as to resolve the multiple boolean issue.
      //Other languages would accept the first boolean as matching the first argument and default the second
      //But with named arguments the argument becomes more obvious
      result6 <- SomeMethodOrConstructor(name: "Stephen")
      result7 <- SomeMethodOrConstructor(dogOwner: false)
      result8 <- SomeMethodOrConstructor("Bill", developer: false)
      result9 <- SomeMethodOrConstructor("Ted", false, dogOwner: true)

      ...
    </pre>
    <br/>
    <p>
      While this approach (used by several languages) does have some appeal, it can lead to all sorts or
      ambiguities and complexities. For example, what if the name named argument is referenced more than once,
      what if some arguments are named and others not named. How does this work with 'varargs'.
    </p>
    <p>
      Indeed, some developers in languages like Java have employed what they call a 'Builder Pattern', this is not actually
      the same 'Builder Pattern' from the <i>Gang of Four Design Pattern</i> book. <br/>
      This takes the approach of duplicating all the properties (so they can be mutated) and then finally creating the
      final object from this mutated state.
    </p>
    <p>
      There some more 'reasonable' approaches used in the 'GoLang' community and the EK9 solution takes an approach similar to that and
      also the mechanisms that are common in 'Haskell' code bases.
    </p>
    <h3>EK9 Approach</h3>
    <p>
      The common design pattern for EK9 (and is applicable in a 'pure' context), is as follows:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>If there are a few arguments (say 1-4), then use method overloading</li>
      <li>If there are many arguments, then create a <i>record</i> to group the arguments as an aggregate</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This then leads to the issue how how to create the <i>record</i> for multiple arguments, this is especially
      true when creating 'library' classes and types.
    </p>
    <p>
      The general approach is to enable some form of 'delegated' construction of the <i>record</i>, this has the following
      flow.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Use a single default constructor that leaves properties all initialised but 'un-set'</li>
      <li>Now use one or more 'pure' functions to initialise the properties that have not been 'set'</li>
      <li>Finally, use a 'defaulting function' to set any properties that have not yet been 'set'</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The other alternative is to use an existing initialised object and copy over the values and then modify the resulting
      objects. An example of this is show later.
    </p>
    <h4 id="design_pattern_library">EK9 library code example</h4>
    <p>
      This example introduces the concept of a 'library' class that performs some sort of service, but can be configured in a
      specific way to operate in slightly different ways,
    </p>
    <pre>#!ek9
defines module simple.library.example

  defines record

    ConfigurationDetails
      name <- String()
      useMapping <- Boolean()
      frequencyOfChecks <- Integer()

      default ConfigurationDetails() as pure

      ConfigurationDetails() as pure
        -> initializer as Consumer of ConfigurationDetails
        initializer(this)

      ConfigurationDetails() as pure
        -> copyFrom as ConfigurationDetails
        this :=: copyFrom

      ConfigurationDetails() as pure
        ->
          initializer as Consumer of ConfigurationDetails
          copyFrom as ConfigurationDetails

        initializer(this)
        this :=: copyFrom

      operator :=:
        -> copyFrom as ConfigurationDetails

        name :=? String(copyFrom.name)
        useMapping :=? Boolean(copyFrom.useMapping)
        frequencyOfChecks :=? Integer(copyFrom.frequencyOfChecks)

      default operator ?
      default operator $

  defines class

    SomeConfigurableService

      configuration as ConfigurationDetails: ConfigurationDetails()

      SomeConfigurableService() as pure
        configuration :=? ConfigurationDetails()

      SomeConfigurableService() as pure
        -> useConfiguration as ConfigurationDetails
        configuration :=? ConfigurationDetails(useConfiguration)

      underTakeServiceOperations() as pure
        stdout <- Stdout()
        if configuration.name?
          stdout.println(`Processing Service operation for ${configuration.name}`)
        if configuration.useMapping
          stdout.println(`Will use mapping`)
        if configuration.frequencyOfChecks?
          stdout.println(`Processing Service frequency ${configuration.frequencyOfChecks}`)

      configurationDetails() as pure
        <- rtn as String: $configuration

//EOF</pre>
    <br/>
    <p>
      The above is fairly straight forward, the properties that would normally have been directly
      located in the 'SomeConfigurableService' <i>class</i> have been pulled out to a separate 'ConfigurationDetails'
      <i>record</i>. This the first major design pattern adjustment, isolating the aggregate data.
    </p>
    <p>
      The second major change in approach is to allow the 'ConfigurationDetails' to be constructed in a way that the
      properties are allocated memory but that the values in that memory are <b>un-set</b>. EK9 has language features that work
      well with this approach.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next major change is to create a number of constructors (all 'pure') that enable the internal state of the
      object (a <i>record</i> in this case) to be mutated (as long as they have not been <b>set</b> yet).<br/>
      This is how EK9 implements
      the concept of 'pure', while it could be argued this is not a totally 'pure' approach; the <b>constructor</b> has to be
      able to initialise its properties (or decide to delegate that initialisation).
      Hence, there are four different forms of <b>constructor</b>.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>A pure default constructor</li>
      <li>A Delegating constructor</li>
      <li>A 'Copy' constructor</li>
      <li>A Haskell like 'Copy' and Delegating constructor</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      You may not need all of these <b>constructors</b>, but as a library provider giving your developers some flexibility is a good idea.
    </p>
    <p>
      The 'Delegation' mechanism to a 'Consumer of ConfigurationDetails' is the main mechanism used to avoid the profusion of overloaded
      constructors (here there are only three properties, but imagine a DTO with 20 properties).
    </p>
    <p>
      To make the 'library' more useful, the following functions have also be provided. These function take either a List or a single
      'Acceptor'/'Consumer' of 'ConfigurationDetails'. Acceptors can be used in a 'non-pure' context and Consumers in a
      'pure' context.
    </p>
    <p>
      In effect this 'Delegating' approach to <b>constructors</b> is the mechanism that removes the need for many overloaded
      <b>constructors</b>.
    </p>
    <pre>
...
  defines function

    defaultConfiguration()
      -> details as ConfigurationDetails
      details.name :=? "default"
      details.useMapping :=? false
      details.frequencyOfChecks :=? 6

    applyConfigurations()
      -> changes as List of Acceptor of ConfigurationDetails
      <- configuration as ConfigurationDetails: ConfigurationDetails()
      for change in changes
        change(configuration)

    applyConfiguration()
      -> change as Acceptor of ConfigurationDetails
      <- configuration as ConfigurationDetails: ConfigurationDetails()
      change(configuration)

    conditionallyApplyConfigurations() as pure
      -> changes as List of Consumer of ConfigurationDetails
      <- configuration as ConfigurationDetails: ConfigurationDetails()
      for change in changes
        change(configuration)

    conditionallyApplyConfiguration() as pure
      -> change as Consumer of ConfigurationDetails
      <- configuration as ConfigurationDetails: ConfigurationDetails()
      change(configuration)
...
    </pre>
    <br/>
    <p>
      Importantly it is these functions (or functions like them) that can be used to 'build' a 'ConfigurationDetails' <i>record</i>.<br/>
      The 'defaultConfiguration' function is designed to be a fallback function to provide reasonable defaults in the event that any bespoke
      configurations did not populate specific properties.
    </p>
    <h4 id="design_pattern_library_client">EK9 client code example</h4>
    <p>
      Now the concept and definition of the 'library' has been established, let's look at how a 'client' might use that 'library'.
    </p>
    <pre>#!ek9
defines module client.code.example

  references
    simple.library.example::ConfigurationDetails
    simple.library.example::applyConfiguration
    simple.library.example::applyConfigurations
    simple.library.example::conditionallyApplyConfiguration
    simple.library.example::defaultConfiguration
    simple.library.example::SomeConfigurableService

  defines function

    testAPlainConfiguration() as pure

      someServer <- SomeConfigurableService()
      someServer.underTakeServiceOperations()

      asConfigured <- someServer.configurationDetails()
      assert asConfigured?

    withSpecificValues() as pure
      -> details as ConfigurationDetails
      details.name :=? "Specific Value"
      details.useMapping :=? false
      details.frequencyOfChecks :=? 21

    testABespokePureConfiguration1() as pure

      someServer <- SomeConfigurableService(conditionallyApplyConfiguration(withSpecificValues))
      someServer.underTakeServiceOperations()

      asConfigured <- someServer.configurationDetails()
      assert asConfigured?

//EOF</pre>
    <br/>
    <p>
      As can be seen from the example client code above, the first function 'testAPlainConfiguration' just creates
      'SomeConfigurableService' using a 'ConfigurationDetails' where none of the properties have been set.<br/>
      The second function 'testABespokePureConfiguration1' employs the 'conditionallyApplyConfiguration' library function
      together with 'withSpecificValues' to create a specific configuration. In effect the client code developer has their
      'withSpecificValues' called back to modify the 'ConfigurationDetails' data by the library.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is this latter point that removes the need for large and complex 'builder' classes and a profusion of overloaded
      <b>constructor</b> methods in 'ConfigurationDetails'.
    </p>
    <p>
      The further example below highlights the flexibility in this approach, for these few properties this is probably not
      necessary, but with many properties and required final default values this approach works very well and flexibly (via composition).
    </p>
    <pre>
...
  defines function

    withSpecificName()
      -> details as ConfigurationDetails
      details.name: "specific"

    enableMapping()
      -> details as ConfigurationDetails
      details.useMapping: true

    testAFlexibleBespokeConfiguration()

      someServer <- SomeConfigurableService(
        applyConfigurations(
          [ withSpecificName, enableMapping, defaultConfiguration ]
          )
        )

      someServer.underTakeServiceOperations()

      asConfigured <- someServer.configurationDetails()
      assert asConfigured?

    testACopyAndInitialisePureConfiguration() as pure

      specifics <- () is Consumer of ConfigurationDetails as pure function
        t.name :=? "Retained Value"
        t.useMapping :=? false

      configuration <- ConfigurationDetails()
      configuration.name :=? "Ignored Value"
      configuration.frequencyOfChecks :=? 16

      someServer <- SomeConfigurableService(ConfigurationDetails(specifics, configuration))

      someServer.underTakeServiceOperations()

      asConfigured <- someServer.configurationDetails()

      //asConfigured would be 'name = "Retained Value", useMapping = false, frequencyOfChecks = 16'
      assert asConfigured?

//EOF</pre>
    <br/>
    <p>
      This final example above, shows how multiple configurations and a final 'default set' can be applied.
      The important aspect of this is that the 'library' provided the mechanism to allow the 'client code' to
      alter and mutate 'ConfigurationDetails' in a very modular way.
    </p>
    <p>
      The function 'testACopyAndInitialisePureConfiguration' uses a more Haskell style approach of passing in
      a basic object to copy from, but also a function that provides the values to override. In this case it also
      demonstrates a 'dynamic function'.
    </p>
    <p>
      Using the approach above it is possible/desirable to create a set of specific configurations and compose those
      configurations in various ways. Clearly for a handful of properties this is not really worth it. But when a a <i>record</i>
      has many properties - this approach enables a very flexible way to create objects even in an 'immutable'/'pure' context.
    </p>
    <h4>Summary</h4>
    <p>
      Given EK9 has introduced the 'pure' keyword and limits 'mutation', it has been important to provide a flexible way to
      create 'immutable' objects in an 'immutable' context, but in a safe manner. Clearly the act of constructing new objects by
      its very nature calls for some degree of 'mutation' of property values.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through the use of the 'Consumer' type and the <b>:=?</b> (assignment if un-set) operator, EK9 has a controlled and modular mechanism
      to be able to construct objects in a <b>safe</b> and extensible/scalable manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      For these reasons and also the shortcomings identified in other languages where argument default values have been employed; EK9
      does not include default argument values.
    </p>
    <h4>Next Steps</h4>
    <p>
      The details on <i>packaging</i> and <i>deploying/publishing</i> your code to an
      <u>artefact server</u> are covered in the next section on <a href="packaging.html">packaging</a>.
