      <h1>Composition in EK9</h1>
    </header>
    <p>
      <b>Composition</b> has been outlined in the <a href="traits.html">traits</a> section in simple form.
      This section will discuss composition in more detail through an example. You may be thinking why labour
      this <i>traits</i> and <u>composition</u> stuff so much?
    </p>
    <p>
      See the rationale and logic below as to why there is so much focus on this.
    </p>
    <h3>Composition background</h3>
    <p>
      In general when Object-Oriented programming first started to gain ground, the movement of defining
      data structures ('structs in C') and having <i>functions</i> manipulate those 'structs' fell out of use.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was generally considered a <u>good thing</u> by Object-Oriented developers, now <i>classes</i> and <i>class</i>
      hierarchies became the main driving force. Initially the <i>classes</i> developed were relatively simple to
      understand. It was not long before very large and deep <i>class</i> hierarchies became common.
      In many cases with multiple inheritance adding to the complexity.
    </p>
    <p>
      The main reason this 'new OOP' approach was consider a <u>good thing</u> is because it enabled data hiding and limited access
      to state data (and specifically its mutation). EK9 has the <a href="basics.html#pure">pure</a> mechanism that enables mutable
      data structures to remain free of <b>mutation</b>. The most important part of the <a href="basics.html#pure">pure</a> approach in
      EK9 is that it works in a pragmatic way and does not focus on the data structure itself but on the processing.
      <br/>
      So for example it is possible in EK9 to pass a set of nested data structures into a <a href="basics.html#pure">pure</a> <i>function</i>
      and that <i>function</i> can take a reference to some part of that data structure and use values in it (but not mutate it).
      <br/>
      However, it is able possible for that same function to take a reference to some part of that same nested data structure, and 'return' an
      object that references that part of the nested data structure. This then 'returned' object could then be used elsewhere in a 'non-pure'
      <i>function</i> or <i>method</i>. Now the data value can be <b>mutated</b> if required.
    </p>
    <p>
      With EK9 <i>records</i> and <i>functions</i> you can now use the old approach again; and it's not a
      bad practice - it's a valid and powerful approach if you wish to adopt a <u>functional</u> development style.
      <br/>
      The <a href="basics.html#pure">pure</a> mechanism in EK9 now enables a more refined control to state data. It also removes the need for
      endless and pointless 'getters' which seem to spread all of 'OOP' code bases.
    </p>
    <p>
      Add into the mix the teaching of Object-Oriented programmers to model 'real life' concepts and the <b>rot</b> set in!
      Yes a Square 'is a' type of Rectangle mathematically, but that does not mean you can or should model it like that in a
      <i>class</i> structure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now throw in the convenience of just wanting some of the same functionality from another class
      and gaining that functionality through inheritance - and we have massive interdependence and coupling.
    </p>
    <p>
      By providing
      <b>protected</b> fields/properties; even 'encapsulation' is lost.
    </p>
    <p>
      With Java <i>classes</i>, things became slightly simpler because it did not support multiple inheritance and
      Java Interfaces only had <i>abstract</i> <i>methods</i> (originally). But again as inheritance was really the main
      mechanism developers focused on to augment and add functionality; hierarchies became quite deep.
    </p>
    <p>
      You may consider the above statements <u>incorrect, opinionated, invalid or extreme</u>. These are opinions,
      but the EK9 language has been driven in part by experience of using 'C', Structs - going through the joy
      and pain of Object-Oriented programming.
    </p>
    <p>
      So why isn't <b>composition</b> more widely used/promoted? It's probably because it has not been made
      easy enough. Imagine a trait/interface with 20 methods on it; implement a class and provide implementations
      for all 20 methods. Now imagine wanting to compose that class with another that implements the same
      trait/interface. You have to write 20 methods that just call <b>delegate.{methodName}</b>!
    </p>
    <p>
      This is what EK9 does for you with the <b>by ...</b> syntax (see later example for details). What this means
      is that a developer can now create a class that has multiple traits but each of those traits (and all the
      methods) can be delegated to existing concrete classes that have already been developed. Additionally, if you
      do what to override a small selection of the methods; you can, and EK9 won't delegate those overridden methods.
    </p>
    <h4>Smaller and well-defined functionality</h4>
    <p>
      In general the smaller, well-defined and immutable a piece functionality is; the:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>more reliable it is</li>
      <li>easier it can be tested</li>
      <li>more reusable it is</li>
      <li>refactoring and improvement is simplified</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID" target="_blank" title="SOLID">SOLID</a> principle can be observed and can be followed through the
      use of <u>composition</u> more easily than just using inheritance.
    </p>
    <p>
      By supporting delegation and multiple inheritance of <i>traits</i>; EK9 enables the developer
      to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interface_segregation_principle" target="_blank" title="Interface">
      apply the 'I' - interface segregation principle</a> with ease.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example; you can define any number of <i>traits</i>; have a small number of <i>classes</i> that
      implement those traits. You can then create a trait that <i>extends</i> those traits and a concrete <i>class</i>
      that then delegates all or some of the implementation to the existing <i>classes</i>.
    </p>
    <h5>Functions</h5>
    <p>
      A <i>function</i> is probably the smallest and most reusable piece of functionality that could
      be developed; in general it has no <u>state</u> of its own. With the advent of Object-Oriented
      programming this very useful and reliable mechanism of development was discarded to some degree. Not so
      much with C++, but with Java to some extent (being sort of reintroduced in Java 8).
    </p>
    <p>
      With EK9 the <i>function</i> is considered a critical, valuable, reliable, robust and scalable software
      <b>construct</b>. By employing <i>function</i> delegates; a mechanism of adjusting functionality of
      <i>classes</i> without sub-classing (inheritance) can be realised. This is shown in
      <a href="classes.html#shape_example">this example (see Square)</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The only disadvantage of using <i>function</i> delegates like this, is that the <i>function</i>
      does not have direct access to the state of the object. Some developers would see this as an
      <u>advantage</u> rather than a <u>disadvantage</u>; as it respects encapsulated data and state.
    </p>
    <p>
      If access to state data is required - then an approach is to model all the 'classes' state data in
      a <i>record</i>. Then if state data access is required in a <i>function</i> the <i>record</i> can be
      passed into the <a href="basics.html#pure">pure</a> function. This provides direct (but immutable) access
      to the data. This does break the 'information hiding' aspect of the class however, this may or may not be
      worthwhile, and it is a matter of judgement.
    </p>
    <h5>Small Classes</h5>
    <p>
      There is a tendency for developers to create <a href="https://wiki.c2.com/?GodClass" target="_blank" title="GOD class">God classes</a>.
      These have way too much functionality or manipulate other objects (as if they were C structs; though
      they go through the motions of Object-Orientation by just using 'getters'/'setters').
      In general, they tend to be very large, link to many other classes or have very deep hierarchies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Breaking these large classes up into much smaller <i>classes, functions</i> and <i>records</i>
      and then composing them together behind a <i>class</i> that delegates the call through to each
      of the smaller classes is a step in the right direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      By creating smaller well-rounded and encapsulated classes; defects and complexity are reduced
      and reuse is increased. They can more easily follow the
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-responsibility_principle" target="_blank" title="Single Responsibility">single responsibility principle</a>.
    </p>
    <h5>Façade</h5>
    <p>
      The approach of breaking up a large class in to several smaller classes may still require some sort of
      unifying 'interface' to some degree (take care here not to build a very large 'interface').
      In most modern languages an <i>interface</i> <b>type</b> would
      be defined with all (or most) the same methods on the <i>classes</i> re-declared. Furthermore the
      <i>class</i> that implements the <i>interface</i> must redeclare/implement those methods yet
      again and must also the call the method on the actual class it will use to provide that functionality.
    </p>
    <p>
      EK9 has a solution to the above through the use of <i>traits</i> as shown in the example below.
      Specifically the 'Employee' using <i>traits</i> <b>by</b> delegating to a matching Property <i>class</i>.
    </p>
    <h4>Inheritance</h4>
    <p>
      There is a separate section on <a href="inheritance.html">inheritance</a>. Use of inheritance
      is still a key technique and useful mechanism.
      Inheritance to model concepts that are naturally structured, rather than inheritance just because
      there is similarity in data elements or processing is the most suitable approach to using inheritance.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a short example; consider a <i>class</i> called <u>ExternalAspect</u> that has properties of
      <u>colour</u> and <u>texture</u>. <u>Human</u>, <u>Bird</u> and <u>Chair</u> all share those
      properties to some degree. But they <b>are not 'an'</b> <u>ExternalAspect</u>!
      They could have a property of <u>ExternalAspect</u> however. With real world examples
      this is sometimes quite obvious, but with more abstract software concepts this become blurred
      or confused at times.
    </p>
    <p>
      But even with real world examples, it is not always appropriate to make <i>class</i> structures and
      inheritance follow those concepts too closely. This is sometimes a major source of confusion as there
      can be a conflict in true reality and what you need to model in software.
    </p>
    <h4>Contradictions</h4>
    <p>
      There are now some contradictions that must now be addressed.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Large class hierarchies lead to complexity and lack of flexibility</li>
      <li>Breaking up classes into smaller implementations, creates many classes to be composed</li>
      <li>Façades can create duplication of method declarations and the interface/implementation duality</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>The EK9 Approach</h4>
    <p>
      We need the benefits of being able to create small well defined <i>traits/classes</i> <b>and</b> the
      benefits of the Façade. But we don't want the disadvantages of either
      (again don't make the Façade too large).
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Function</i> delegates provide the <b>first</b> part of the solution.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Traits</i> provide the <b>second</b> part. The <i>trait</i> provides a simple well-defined
      public interface that can support default functionality and <i>abstract</i> method signatures.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <b>third</b> part of the solution is to enable multiple inheritance of <i>traits</i>.
      Façades can now be defined just by creating a new <i>trait</i> that has <i>traits</i> of all the features
      needed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <b>fourth</b> and final part of the solution is to incorporate <i>class/object</i> delegation;
      so that when defining a <i>class</i>; repetition is reduced and calls each
      and every method that require delegation are automatically undertaken by EK9.
      But importantly if you do wish to provide a new implementation you can.
    </p>
    <p>
      See the example below, specifically:<br/><br/>
      <b>Employee with trait of IRole by role, IPayrollCalculator by payroll</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Employee implements two <i>traits</i> <b>IRole/IPayrollCalculator</b>. But it immediately
      delegates the implementation to <b>role</b> and <b>payroll</b> field/property objects.
    </p>
    <h4>Example</h4>
    <p>
      The use of composition is really a design pattern that can be used with any language.
      The diagrams below are from a
      <a href="https://realpython.com/inheritance-composition-python/" target="_blank" title="Python Composition">Python example</a>, which
      was originally taken from a book on C++ design. The site is quite long (but well detailed
      and interesting). The main points of contrast are shown in two diagrams, one for inheritance and
      one for composition.
    </p>
    <p>
      The design has remained fairly unaltered in the EK9 implementation, just a few alterations here and there.
      While the final design might not be perfect or what some OO designers would like, it does provide a good
      example of the issues and proposes a solution that could be used or refined and improved further.
    </p>
    <h5>Inheritance</h5>
    <img alt="Inheritance" src="ic-class-explosion.jpg" style="width:700px;height:700px;">
    <p>
      As you can see the inheritance design is quite complex and has multiple inheritance.
    </p>
    <h5>Composition</h5>
    <img alt="Composition" src="ic-policy-based-composition.jpg" style="width:700px;height:700px;">
    <p>
      The composition design is simpler and focuses on composition around the employee. It might have been
      more appropriate to model 'Employment', 'Employee' and 'Person' rather than just use 'Employee'; but
      that is a modelling discussion rather than the focus of this; which is <u>composition</u>.
    </p>

    <h5>Composition as above in EK9</h5>
    <p>
      The following example is quite long, this is to ensure that the benefits of the EK9 approach
      to composition can be seen.
    </p>
    <p>
      The same names for the <b>constructs</b> have been used in the EK9 code example below. This makes
      the mapping between the composition diagram above and the EK9 code more obvious. Method names have been altered
      and there is a slight change in the inheritance structure (which is more logical). In all; it is about 250
      lines of code. The implementation is broadly the same as the Python code, There are several alternatives
      to the implementation in EK9 (such as using <i>text</i> <b>constructs</b> or <i>components</i>). These
      have <b>not</b> been done to keep the example a similar to the Python and the point of using composition.

    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <p>
      The key points for this example are:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The <i>trait</i> concept in EK9 facilitates composition</li>
      <li>It is necessary to actually define the <i>traits</i></li>
      <li>The abstraction and structure has to be explicit in EK9</li>
      <li><b>Constructs</b> <i>record</i>, <i>trait</i> and <i>class</i> provide different structure <b>constructs</b></li>
      <li>'Employee' <i>methods</i> <b>calculatePayroll</b> and <b>performDuties</b> are automatically delegated</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The automatic delegation of <i>methods</i> on 'Employee' mean that the <i>methods</i> do not need implementing.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the main purpose of this example is not to compare the EK9 language to Python, it is quite clear
      that EK9 has been inspired by Python in terms of layout and syntax. But also inspired by Java/C#/Scala
      and C++ in terms of structure and explicit extension/implementation. It's not enough just to define method signatures
      that match up, an actual <i>trait</i> must be declared and used. This is a good thing; as it is explicit and type safe
      (it is not possible to pass the wrong type of object just because the method signatures match!).
    </p>
    <h5>SOLID</h5>
    <p>
      The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID" target="_blank" title="SOLID">SOLID</a> principle as been observed quite well in the example.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Single Responsibility - Each Role is isolated, each PayrollPolicy is isolated</li>
      <li>Open-closed principle - clearly the behaviour in roles and payroll policies can change but modification to their bases is not needed</li>
      <li>Liskov substitution principle - Any of the roles and payroll policies can be replaced without altering the correctness of the program</li>
      <li>Interface segregation principle - IRole and IPayrollCalculator are separate interfaces/traits and so are segregated</li>
      <li>Dependency inversion principle - The Employee class is only aware of IRole and IPayrollCalculator; at construction it is given the implementation it
        is to use.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h5>Advantages</h5>
    <p>
      Should alterations to any of the implementations referenced above be needed, only a small part of the code
      would need to be adjusted. The effects of such changes are quite direct and obvious.
      In short; it is obvious where to look to alter 'manager' pay or 'secretary' activity text.
    </p>
    <p>
      Changes to addresses would be done in the 'Address Book'.
    </p>
    <h5>Issues</h5>
    <p>
      Output is hardwired to 'Stdout',
      What about adding new employees? Altering an existing employee job role, adding a new job role? This
      solution does not address these functions. But more importantly it does not facilitate the development
      of such functions. It's not obvious where or how they could be implemented.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are also a couple of issues in the code around 'ProductivitySystem'. The 'EmployeeDatabase' is
      directly coupled to 'ProductivitySystem'. It is also directly coupled to 'PayrollSystem' and 'AddressBook'!
    </p>
    <p>
      The 'ProductivitySystem' seems to have mixed responsibilities. Is it just for tracking productivity; or
      is it also some type of HR system that is to be used for defining what roles should be available for a
      notional title? This is very confused and should really be separated out from the 'ProductivitySystem'.
    </p>
    <p>
      The 'AddressBook' is only used by the 'EmployeeDatabase', which is fine in of itself. But this means that
      it cannot be easily swapped out for some type of database or file or remote service. The 'EmployeeDatabase'
      is directly linked to this implementation of the 'AddressBook'.
    </p>
    <p>
      This page has now moved into the realm of software design, rather than just the EK9 language.
      But will be used as an example of how to use other EK9 language features to address the above issues.
    </p>
    <p>
      The intention here is not to criticize the example from the website (thank you, Isaac Rodriguez for taking
      the time to produce such a good example), but really to show how the EK9
      language features can be used in different ways. In fact most of the issues raised here were not really the
      main subject of the website, but are really the 'Driver' infrastructure.
    </p>
    <h5>Revisiting</h5>
    <p>
      The example above will be revisited in the <a href="components.html">Components</a> section, where it will
      be refined further. Then in the section on <a href="dependencyInjection.html">dependency injection</a>
      more alterations and alternatives will be discussed.
    </p>
    <h3>Next Steps</h3>
    <p>
      The use of <a href="inheritance.html">inheritance</a> is covered in the next section.
      <a href="components.html">Components</a> will also be of interest; as they too enable composition,
      but into larger building blocks.
