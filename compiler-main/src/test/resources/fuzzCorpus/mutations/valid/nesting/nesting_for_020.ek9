<?-
  Mutation Test: Nested For Loops (10 levels)
  Tests compiler/parser handling of for loop nesting at maximum allowed depth.

  Complexity: 1 (base) + 10 (for loops) + 10 (for ranges) = 21 (under 50 limit)
  Nesting depth: 10 (at maximum limit)
  Should compile successfully - no errors expected.
