  Dynamic Class/Function Fuzz Test: Dynamic Class with Abstract Methods
  Tests: DYNAMIC_CLASS_CANNOT_BE_ABSTRACT (via abstract methods)

  Description: Dynamic classes cannot contain abstract methods. All methods
  in a dynamic class must have implementations. This test verifies that
  declaring abstract methods within a dynamic class is rejected.

  Expected: SYMBOL_DEFINITION error for abstract method in dynamic class
  Current: Should reject dynamic classes containing abstract methods
