<?-
  Dynamic Class/Function Fuzz Test: Mixed Named and Unnamed Parameters
  Tests: EITHER_ALL_PARAMETERS_NAMED_OR_NONE

  Description: EK9 enforces consistency - either ALL capture parameters must be
  named, or NONE can be named. Mixing named and unnamed parameters is prohibited
  to maintain code clarity and prevent confusion.

  Expected: SYMBOL_DEFINITION error for mixed named/unnamed captures
  Current: Should reject captures with inconsistent naming
