  Dynamic Class/Function Fuzz Test: Named Dynamic Class in Generic Type
  Tests: GENERIC_WITH_NAMED_DYNAMIC_CLASS

  Description: Named dynamic classes cannot be used within generic type definitions.
  EK9 prohibits naming dynamic classes in generic contexts to avoid naming conflicts
  and complexity with generic type instantiation.

  Expected: SYMBOL_DEFINITION error for named dynamic class in generic type
  Current: Should correctly detect and reject named dynamic in generic context
