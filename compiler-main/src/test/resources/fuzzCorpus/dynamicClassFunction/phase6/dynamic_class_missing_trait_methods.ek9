<?-
  Dynamic Class/Function Fuzz Test: Dynamic Class Missing Trait Method Implementation
  Tests: DYNAMIC_CLASS_MUST_IMPLEMENT_ABSTRACTS

  Description: When a dynamic class uses a trait with abstract methods, it MUST
  provide implementations for all abstract methods. Missing implementations should
  be detected and rejected.

  Expected: FULL_RESOLUTION error for missing trait method implementation
  Current: Should detect missing implementations in dynamic classes
