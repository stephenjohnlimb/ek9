  Dynamic Class/Function Fuzz Test: Dynamic Class Extending Function
  Tests: INCOMPATIBLE_GENUS

  Description: Dynamic classes can only extend traits or parameterized generic types.
  Attempting to extend a function with a dynamic class is an INCOMPATIBLE_GENUS error.

  Expected: EXPLICIT_TYPE_SYMBOL_DEFINITION error for class extending function
  Current: Should reject dynamic class extending function
