  Dynamic Class/Function Fuzz Test: Dynamic Function Extending Class
  Tests: INCOMPATIBLE_GENUS

  Description: Dynamic functions can only extend functions (abstract or open).
  Attempting to extend a class/trait with a dynamic function is an
  INCOMPATIBLE_GENUS error.

  Expected: EXPLICIT_TYPE_SYMBOL_DEFINITION error for function extending class
  Current: Should reject dynamic function extending class
