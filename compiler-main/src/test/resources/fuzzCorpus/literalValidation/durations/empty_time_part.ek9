  Literal Validation Fuzz Test: Duration - Empty Time Part
  Tests if EK9 catches duration with empty time part (PT with no time components) at compile time.

  Expected: Should fail (PT must be followed by time components like PT1H or PT30M)
  Actual: Compiles successfully, becomes unset at runtime
