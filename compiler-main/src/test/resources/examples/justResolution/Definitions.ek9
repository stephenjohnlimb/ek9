#!ek9
<?-
  This set of ek9 source is designed to push the compiler to the
  resolution checking stage of high level constructs.
  i.e. types, records, traits, ...

  So define these in one named scope (module) then resolve within that module.
  Also add a separate module (with a different module name) and check that they can be
  resolved in a fully qualifies manner.

  Also add another module (scope) that uses references and check that they can be resolved with
  just the short name of the construct.

  So, go through the define phase, references phase and on to the first resolution stage.
  But this won't work in terms of expanding out generic types.
