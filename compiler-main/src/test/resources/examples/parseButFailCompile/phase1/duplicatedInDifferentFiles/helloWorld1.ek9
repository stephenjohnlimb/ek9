#!ek9
<?-
  Just to check for duplicated Symbol of same name but in different files.
  But also check it is not possible to redefine something from the main ek9 built in constants.

  Note you can redefine types, functions and the like in different package even though they are
  in the main ek9 built in types. Not a good idea! But you can do it.
