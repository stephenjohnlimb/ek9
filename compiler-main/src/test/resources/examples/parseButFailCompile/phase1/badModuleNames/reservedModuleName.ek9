<?-
  Tests that module names org.ek9.lang and org.ek9.math are reserved
  and cannot be used outside of compiler bootstrapping.

  Note: INVALID_MODULE_NAME error occurs at line 0 (module definition token issue)
  which prevents @Error directive matching. This is documented in ERROR_RECOVERY_ISSUES.md
  Therefore this test uses error count validation instead of @Error directives.
