  Next expression range usage.

  identifier neg=NOT? IN range

  There is also another use of 'IN'
  left=expression IS? neg=NOT? IN right=expression
  This requires that the right.type has a contains method that accepts left.type are a parameter and returns a Boolean.

  So this is like result <- someVariable in 21 ... 600
  i.e. Is 'someVariable' greater than or equal to 21 and is 'someVariable' less than or equal to 600
  Basically we just need to:
  1. Check that the types on the range expressions are the same.
  2. Ensure there is a comparator on the someVariable.type that accepts the expression.type

  The 'NOT' part is just an inversion of that result - still just a Boolean.
