<?-
  So what is a guard expression.
  Well first don't confuse ':=?' with '?='
  There are question marks and equal signs involved they both deal with 'is-set'.
  The key difference is:
  someValue :=? 66 // means that if someValue is currently unset then assign it the value of 66.
  Whereas result <- someValue ?= Integer() // means that if the act of assigning someValue to a value (integer in this case)
  means that someValue is unset then set result to false, otherwise set it to true.
